# Heterogeneous accumulation: cross-frontier transfers never launder an unverified claim

`Accumulation.lean` proves the scaling core for **one** frozen verifier. This file proves the part that
is *not* in the folding/PCD literature and is the Vela moat: an accumulator whose deltas may be
justified two ways —

* **natively**, by a witness the frontier's own frozen verifier accepts; or
* **by transfer**, importing the already-verified best level of *another* frontier through a
  soundness-preserving map (the Theorem 23 verifier-homomorphism, `Vela/Transfer.lean`).

A transfer is the dangerous case: it credits a claim on frontier `dst` *without* re-running `dst`'s
native verifier. The worry is laundering — importing junk across a frontier boundary. The headline
theorem `accumulate_state_verified` proves this cannot happen: at every point in the fold, **every
nonzero entry of the accumulated state is `Verified`** — grounded, through any chain of sound transfers,
in real native verifications. Cross-frontier credit is exactly as sound as native credit, never weaker.

Mathlib-free; compiles standalone (`lean Vela/HeteroAccumulation.lean`).

## Honest scope
* `Verified.transfer` *encodes* Theorem 23's soundness as a constructor: the transfer registry `lk` is
  assumed to contain only sound maps (that assumption is what `Vela/Transfer.lean` discharges for
  concrete transfers, e.g. Sidon translation). This file proves the *accumulation* preserves
  verification given sound transfers; it does not re-prove any individual transfer's soundness.
* A transfer imports the source's *current best* (`S src`); downward-closure of weaker levels is out of
  scope. Constant-size cryptographic proof carrying and adoption are also outside this model.

/-! ## A concrete cross-frontier import (the moat, demonstrated)

Frontier 0 verifies level 5 natively; a sound transfer `0 → 1` is registered (here the identity map,
standing in for a proven verifier-homomorphism). Then frontier 1 is `Verified` at level 5 with **no
native witness of its own** — purely by importing frontier 0's verified result. This is a discovery on
frontier 1 that single-frontier search cannot see, made sound by the transfer. -/

private def lkDemo : Frontier → Frontier → Option (Level → Level) :=

  Verified.transfer (src := 0) (dst := 1) (g := id) (L := 5)
    (Verified.native (rfl : nvDemo 0 5 = true)) (rfl : lkDemo 0 1 = some id)
