//! Pure separable reducer over canonical events.
//!
//! `apply_event` is the deterministic state-transition function: given a
//! `Project` and a `StateEvent`, it produces the next `Project`. It does
//! not construct events, validate proposals, or call into network code.
//! It is the inverse pole of `proposals::apply_proposal`, which prepares
//! an event from a proposal and a current state.
//!
//! Why this matters: v0 doctrine says "proposal → canonical event →
//! reducer → replayable frontier state." Until v0.3, the reducer step was
//! implicit inside `apply_proposal` — replay was hash-walking, not
//! reduction. Phase C of the v0.3 focusing run pulls the reducer out so a
//! second implementation can independently reduce a canonical event log
//! and produce byte-identical state.
//!
//! Replay verification (`replay_from_genesis` + `verify_replay`) is the
//! check that turns "state was claimed to result from these events" into
//! "state demonstrably results from these events when re-derived from
//! scratch."
