# Vela protocol specification v0.105.0

> **CLI-surface note (v0.700).** The command surface was cut to a ~70-command
> core in v0.700. Event kinds and reducer semantics in this spec remain
> normative (the reducer still replays every historical event) but some CLI
> invocations referenced below (`vela trace`, `vela bridge`, `vela federation`,
> `vela discord`, `vela impact`) describe commands that were removed from the
> binary. The events they minted are still valid state.

> **Version-scheme note.** Two numbering schemes appear in this repository.
> Markers of the form `v0.X` or `v0.X.Y` (v0.32, v0.78, v0.105, v0.262, …)
> are the original micro-version stamps: each names the working cycle that
> introduced a feature, kept as historical provenance in comments, doc
> strings, and this spec's section headings. The workspace release version
> (`0.700.0`, reported by `vela version`) is a separate, later scheme that
> began at 0.700 with the consolidated substrate. The two do not compare:
> v0.78 is *older* than 0.700, not newer. Micro-version markers are never
> bumped retroactively; new work cites the release scheme.


This document defines the shipped v0 language kernel for portable,
correctable frontier state. It is normative for finding bundles, typed links,
proposal records, canonical events, proof freshness, content addressing,
frontier epistemic confidence, entity resolution, content-addressed artifacts,
proof packets, and Git-compatible storage.

Runtime objects, federation, and dedicated constellation interfaces are not part
of the v0 protocol contract.

The Carina kernel name is reserved for the primitive object and event model
inside this protocol. See [`CARINA.md`](CARINA.md) for the kernel vocabulary;
the external-artifact adapter ships as the `vela ingest` command
(section 6's event kinds cover the records it mints).

The protocol boundary is the invariant this spec enforces throughout:
scientific activity is source material until it enters the proposal -> diff ->
review -> accepted event -> deterministic replay path. Derived answer pages,
graph views, benchmark tables, and source dashboards are projections over
replayed frontier state, not separate truth stores.

## Contents

- §1–§14: the v0 language kernel (design principles, primitives, content
  addressing, confidence, links, proposal/event protocol, storage, proof,
  signals, conformance, access tiers, changelog, integrity).
- §The minimal core: six primitives of mathematical state change (the frozen
  producer-facing surface).
- §Vela invariants: the operational invariants every implementation must hold.
- §ID prefix registry: the authoritative meaning of every live `v*_` prefix.
- §Status planes: the four-plane vocabulary map.
- §The canonical event log: the concrete walkthrough of `.vela/events/`.
- §Conformance: how a third party proves agreement with the reference.
- §Appendix: Signed checkpoints (deferred).

## 1. design principles

1. **Narrow waist.** The substrate solves persistent, correctable scientific
   state.
2. **Finding first.** The paper is a source artifact. The finding bundle is the
   primary state object.
3. **State transition first.** Truth-changing writes become proposals and then
   canonical events.
4. **Disagreement is structural.** Contradictions and contested claims remain
   inspectable instead of being flattened.
5. **Git-compatible.** Frontiers can be versioned with normal files, commits,
   branches, and diffs. Network propagation remains outside v0.
6. **Content-addressed.** Stable content produces stable IDs.
7. **Correction over deletion.** Corrections preserve history.
8. **Agent output is source, not truth.** Agent traces, synthetic reports, and
   benchmark outputs require source/evidence/condition grounding and review.

## 2. primitive set

Vela v0 has three protocol-level primitives:

- **Object:** finding bundles are primary. Supporting kernel objects include
  artifacts, negative results, trajectories, datasets, code artifacts,
  replications, predictions, and resolutions.
- **Link:** typed relationships between findings.
- **Event:** the authoritative state-transition record.

A frontier snapshot is a bounded, reviewable frontier state over a scientific
question. It is not a claim of final truth. ("Belief state" is the theory-side
nomenclature for the same object. See `docs/THEORY.md`.)

### 2.1 finding bundle

A finding bundle is one assertion plus its evidence, conditions, entities,
confidence, provenance, flags, annotations, attachments, and links.

Required fields:

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `id` | `vf_...` content address |
| `version` | Finding schema version |
| `previous_version` | Previous finding ID if corrected |
| `assertion` | The bounded claim text and type |
| `evidence` | Evidence class, method, spans, model system, and statistics |
| `conditions` | Scope boundaries such as species, assay, comparator, endpoint |
| `confidence` | Frontier epistemic support and components |
| `provenance` | Source and extraction metadata |
| `flags` | Review-relevant state such as gap, contested, retracted |
| `links` | Typed relationships to other findings |
| `annotations` | Lightweight notes or caveats |
| `created` / `updated` | Timestamps |

### 2.2 source, evidence, and condition projections

Frontier snapshots may carry derived projections:

- `sources`: source artifacts such as papers, PDFs, JATS files, CSV rows,
  notes, agent traces, research traces, benchmark outputs, notebook entries,
  experiment logs, and synthetic reports.
- `evidence_atoms`: exact source-grounded units bearing on one finding.
- `condition_records`: materialized condition boundaries for one finding.
- `artifacts`: content-addressed protocols, trial registry records, supplements,
  notebooks, tables, figures, model outputs, dataset manifests, and files.

These projections support proof and review. They are not authoritative
transition logs. Older frontiers may omit them; the reference implementation can
derive them for check/export/proof and materialize them during normalize without
rewriting canonical events. In v0, writable normalization is a pre-transition
repair step: once canonical events exist, further durable changes should be
represented as reviewed state transitions instead of post hoc normalization.

### 2.3 artifact object

An artifact is a durable byte or pointer commitment:

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `id` | `va_...` content address |
| `kind` | `dataset`, `clinical_trial_record`, `protocol`, `supplement`, `notebook`, `code`, `model_output`, `table`, `figure`, `registry_record`, `lab_file`, `source_file`, or `other` |
| `content_hash` | `sha256:<64hex>` commitment |
| `storage_mode` | `local_blob`, `local_file`, `remote`, or `pointer` |
| `locator` | local path, blob path, remote URL, or accession |
| `source_url` | original upstream page or record |
| `target_findings` | findings the artifact bears on |
| `metadata` | adapter-specific structured fields |
| `retracted` | historical artifact no longer active in proof readiness |
| `access_tier` | public, restricted, or classified |

`artifact.asserted` carries the full artifact inline. Replay reconstructs the
artifact table from events. `artifacts/artifacts.json`,
`artifacts/artifact-audit.json`, and `artifacts/blob-map.json` are canonical
proof packet files. When a license-compatible local artifact can be checked,
`vela proof` copies the bytes into `artifacts/blobs/sha256/<hash>` and validates
them against the recorded content hash. Retracted artifacts remain in
`artifacts.json` and RO-Crate history, but their profile and blob issues move to
the audit's deterministic `historical_issues` list and do not block a current
proof packet.

### 2.4 reserved concepts

Future layers may add `ProtocolRecord`, `ExperimentRecord`, `ResultRecord`,
first-class `Observation`, runtime writeback, network propagation, and dedicated
constellation interfaces. They are outside v0 until they have replay, writeback,
proof/export, and review/merge semantics.

Research traces are currently represented as source artifacts, not as a new
authority primitive. A trace may summarize an agent run, proof search, benchmark
run, notebook session, or lab execution. It can carry verifier attachments and
formalization-fidelity questions, but it cannot mutate frontier state without a
proposal and accepted canonical event. The reference CLI validates traces with
`vela trace validate` and compiles them into pending `research_trace.review`
proposals with `vela trace propose`. Proof packets include validated trace
projections at `research-traces/research-traces.json` and
`research-traces/verifier-attachments.json`.

The `Trajectory` (v0.50) and `NegativeResult` (v0.49) primitives map
to what AI-research-runtime systems call workstreams and failed
explorations respectively. See §6.1 / §6.3 below for the kernel
event surface.

### 2.5 artifact packet

`carina.artifact_packet.v0.1` is an interchange packet for external runtimes
that produce provenance-bearing artifacts.

The packet contains a producer, topic, created time, immutable artifacts with
`sha256:*` hashes and parent lineage, candidate claims linked to packet
artifacts, and open needs that become gap-style proposals.

Import rules:

- packet artifacts map to `artifact.assert` proposals
- candidate claims map to `finding.add` proposals
- open needs map to gap-style `finding.add` proposals
- packet artifact ids and parent ids stay in proposal provenance
- `--apply-artifacts` may accept artifact records immediately
- truth-changing findings and gaps remain pending review

No external runtime receives automatic authority. The accepted event is the
state transition.

### 2.6 scientific diff pack

A Scientific Diff Pack (`vsd_...`) is the reviewable unit for a proposed set of
frontier state changes. It aggregates one or more proposal records and exposes
the review grammar a human needs before accepting, rejecting, or requesting
revision:

- source artifacts
- proposed operations
- affected findings
- evidence deltas
- confidence deltas
- contradiction effects
- downstream impacts
- validation results
- required reviewers
- exact CLI equivalents

Each member proposal is also classified into one operation class:
`add_finding`, `add_evidence_atom`, `repair_locator`, `repair_span`,
`resolve_entity`, `add_link`, `add_caveat`, `revise_confidence`,
`mark_contradiction`, `open_gap`, or `request_downstream_review`. Pack
inspection reports operation counts, non-mutating preview counts when a member
proposal is canonical in the local frontier, and whether accepting the pack
would make proof state stale. Confidence-changing operations must carry a
review reason plus at least one source or evidence reference; missing fields are
reported as validation results rather than silently accepted.

A pack is not a truth object and does not bypass the event log. Agent-produced
packs remain source material until local review records a verdict and accepted
member proposals become canonical frontier events. Pack inspection can be
rendered in Workbench or as JSON with `vela diff-pack inspect <frontier>
<pack-id> --json`.

The boundary is explicit:

- **Pack:** groups proposed work into a reviewer-facing unit.
- **Member proposal:** describes the concrete local state transition.
- **Reviewed event:** records the verdict, reviewer, reason, member counts, and
  proof freshness impact.
- **Accepted member event:** mutates frontier state through the existing
  proposal reducer.

### 2.7 scoped scientific attestation

A scoped scientific attestation (`vatt_...`) is a local reviewer statement
about one target:

- `vsd_*` Scientific Diff Pack
- `vrp_*` review packet
- `vpf_*` proof packet
- `vev_*` canonical event

The record names the reviewer id, optional ORCID, optional ROR affiliation,
reviewer role, declared scope, reason, and timestamp. Supported scopes are
`source_extraction`, `method_review`, `statistical_review`,
`domain_relevance`, `translation_clarity`, and `policy_approval`.

For `vev_*` targets, Vela also appends a canonical `attestation.recorded`
event that points at the target event. For other targets, the attestation is a
local review artifact under `.vela/attestations/`.

This primitive separates expert scope from global agreement. It does not imply
institutional consensus, multi-actor signing, or clinical actionability.

### 2.8 protocol ingestion source material

Protocol ingestion accepts structured material from tools, notebooks, agents,
and reviewers without granting authority to that material.

Supported source contracts include:

- research traces
- score returns
- notebook outputs

Notebook outputs use `vela.notebook_output.v0.1`. A valid notebook output names
the objective, inputs, code hash, environment, outputs, metrics, verifier
attachments, and review boundary. It is source material. It does not write
frontier state, create review events, or claim accepted findings.

Score returns can compile into `vela.return_to_draft_events.v2`. The compiled
artifact contains draft review events with source-return paths, source hashes,
case ids, task ids, arm scores, and authority boundaries. These draft events
are not canonical events. They require explicit maintainer review before any
accepted event can mutate frontier state.

The boundary is explicit:

- **Source material:** a returned file, trace, or notebook output submitted for
  review.
- **Draft event:** a previewable candidate event compiled from source material.
- **Reviewed event:** the only layer that can accept, reject, revise, or caveat
  trusted frontier state.

## 3. content addressing

Finding IDs are computed from content:

```text
SHA-256(normalize(assertion.text) + "|" + assertion.type + "|" + provenance_id)
```

`provenance_id` is `doi`, then `pmid`, then source title. The ID is `vf_` plus
the first 16 hex characters of the hash.

Source records use `vs_...`, evidence atoms use `vea_...`, condition records use
`vcnd_...`, artifacts use `va_...`, proposals use `vpr_...`, and canonical
events use `vev_...`. The full prefix registry, the authoritative meaning of
every live `v*_` prefix, including the known `vat_` and `vtr_` collisions,
lives in §ID prefix registry below.

## 4. confidence

`confidence.score` means bounded frontier epistemic support for the finding as
currently represented. It is not extraction accuracy, not truth probability, and
not review consensus by itself.

Vela keeps three notions separate:

- `confidence.score`: frontier epistemic support.
- `confidence.extraction_confidence`: extraction accuracy confidence.
- review state: proposals, canonical events, contestation flags, and signals.

The computed score uses:

```text
score = evidence_strength * replication_strength * model_relevance * sample_strength
        - review_penalty + calibration_adjustment
```

The normalized component names are `evidence_strength`,
`replication_strength`, `sample_strength`, `model_relevance`, `review_penalty`,
and `calibration_adjustment`. Legacy component names may be accepted on input
for compatibility.

## 5. links

Core v0 link types:

| Type | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `supports` | Source finding provides evidence for target |
| `contradicts` | Findings oppose each other under comparable or overlapping conditions |
| `extends` | Source builds on or broadens target |
| `depends` | Source validity depends on target |
| `replicates` | Source independently reproduces target |
| `supersedes` | Source replaces target |
| `synthesized_from` | Source was compiled from one or more targets |

Links may include confidence, notes, evidence spans, conditional text, and
inference provenance. Link-derived outputs are review surfaces unless accepted
through normal frontier review.

### v0.10: domain-neutral enum extensions

The first non-bio frontier published to the public hub (a particle-astrophysics
WIMP direct-detection frontier) surfaced that the v0 enum sets were
biology-leaning. v0.10 added domain-neutral entries, additively, without
changing content addressing for pre-v0.10 frontiers:

- **Entity type:** `particle` (WIMPs, photons), `instrument` (XENONnT and JWST,
  capital objects that run measurements), `dataset` (instrument data releases
  distinct from the paper that reports them), `quantity` (named numerical
  values with units, e.g. `28 GeV/c^2`). The pre-v0.10 entries (`gene`,
  `protein`, …) and the `other` escape valve remain.
- **Assertion type:** `measurement` (numerical-quantity reports), `exclusion`
  (upper/lower bound at a confidence level). Pre-v0.10 entries unchanged.
- **Provenance source type:** `data_release` (instrument runs, observation
  campaigns, dataset versions that are themselves the substantive object).
  Pre-v0.10 entries unchanged.

Schema URL bumps `v0.8.0 → v0.10.0` for new frontiers; the validator accepts
both URLs so pre-v0.10 frontiers (BBB, BBB-extension, the v0.8 cross-frontier
conformance vector) replay byte-identically under a v0.10 binary.

### v0.8: cross-frontier link targets

`Link.target` may take two shapes:

- `vf_<16hex>`: references a finding in this same frontier.
- `vf_<16hex>@vfr_<16hex>`: references a finding in a different frontier
  (the trailing `vfr_` is the target frontier's content-addressed id).

Cross-frontier targets are valid only if the dependent frontier declares a
matching `vfr_id` in `frontier.dependencies` with both a `locator` and a
`pinned_snapshot_hash`. Strict validation refuses cross-frontier targets
without a declared dep.

Consumers resolve a dep by cloning its frontier repo (the `locator`) and
verifying the replayed snapshot matches the dependent's pinned hash. The
pin is the integrity guarantee; partial trust is not a state v0.8
supports.

## 6. proposal and event protocol

The public write boundary is a `vela.proposal.v0.1` proposal. Truth-changing
commands create pending proposals by default. `--apply` accepts and applies the
proposal locally in one step.

Accepted proposals append a canonical `StateEvent`, apply the reducer,
recompute derived state, and mark proof stale when appropriate.

Core proposal kinds:

| Kind | CLI surface |
|------|-------------|
| `finding.add` | `vela finding add` |
| `finding.review` | `vela land` (drafts the proposal) |
| `finding.note` | `vela finding note` |
| `finding.caveat` | `vela finding caveat` |
| `finding.confidence_revise` | `vela finding revise` |
| `finding.reject` | `vela finding reject` |
| `finding.retract` | `vela finding retract` |
| `finding.contribution.recorded` | `vela finding contribution` |

Core event kinds:

| Kind | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `finding.asserted` | Add a finding |
| `finding.reviewed` | Record review judgment |
| `finding.noted` | Attach a note |
| `finding.caveated` | Attach a caveat |
| `finding.confidence_revised` | Revise confidence interpretation |
| `finding.rejected` | Mark a finding rejected |
| `finding.retracted` | Mark retraction state |
| `finding.contribution.recorded` | Record claim-level attribution (who produced which unit) — descriptive provenance, never a verdict |
| `finding.superseded` | Mark a finding superseded by a replacement |
| `finding.span_repaired` | Mechanical evidence-span/locator repair (v0.66+) |
| `finding.dependency_invalidated` | Per-dependent cascade event from an upstream retraction |
| `negative_result.asserted` | Deposit a NegativeResult (`vnr_*`) — see §6.1 |
| `negative_result.reviewed` | Record review verdict on a NegativeResult |
| `negative_result.retracted` | Mark a NegativeResult retracted |
| `trajectory.created` | Open a Trajectory (`vtr_*`) — see §6.2 |
| `trajectory.step_appended` | Append a step (`vts_*`) to an existing Trajectory |
| `trajectory.reviewed` | Record review verdict on a Trajectory |
| `trajectory.retracted` | Mark a Trajectory retracted |
| `tier.set` | Re-classify a kernel object's read-side access tier — see §13 |
| `frontier.conflict_detected` | Federation observation: peer view of a finding diverges from ours; see §6.4 |
| `frontier.conflict_resolved` | Reviewer verdict paired with a prior `frontier.conflict_detected`; see §6.4 |
| `bridge.reviewed` | Reviewer verdict on a `vbr_*` cross-frontier bridge (v0.67); reducer arm is a no-op on findings, the verdict projects onto `Bridge.status` on read. Required payload: `bridge_id`, `status` (one of `confirmed` or `refuted`), optional `note`. Constructor at `crates/vela-protocol/src/events.rs:386-420`; validator arm at `crates/vela-protocol/src/events.rs:869-895`; constant `EVENT_KIND_BRIDGE_REVIEWED` at `events.rs:125`. |
| `replication.deposited` | Append a `Replication` record to `Project.replications` (v0.70); idempotent on the `vrep_*` id. Required payload: `replication` (the full record). Validator arm at `crates/vela-protocol/src/events.rs:829-849`; reducer arm at `crates/vela-protocol/src/reducer.rs:830-848`; state helper `state::deposit_replication` at `crates/vela-protocol/src/state.rs:610-657`. |
| `prediction.deposited` | Append a `Prediction` record to `Project.predictions` (v0.70); idempotent on the `vpred_*` id. Required payload: `prediction` (the full record). Validator arm at `crates/vela-protocol/src/events.rs:850-868`; reducer arm at `crates/vela-protocol/src/reducer.rs:850-868`; state helper `state::deposit_prediction` at `crates/vela-protocol/src/state.rs:661-700`. |
| `review.accepted` / `review.rejected` / `review.revision_requested` | A reviewer's decision on a proposal, recorded as a signed, append-only event targeting the proposal (`target.type = "proposal"`, `target.id = vpr_*`). Side-table events (`before_hash = after_hash = NULL_HASH`), transparent to the per-finding hash chain; audit-only on the finding projection. Required payload: `proposal_id` (`vpr_*`), `proposal_kind`, `verdict` (must agree with the kind), optional `applied_event_id` (`vev_*`, accepts only), optional `legacy_backfill` (true for migration-synthesized unsigned events). Signed under the reviewer key (key custody, like accept). Proposal `status` is a PROJECTION of these events (plus, for an accept, the domain event it produced); the projection is verified against the stored field by `proposals::verify_proposal_decision_parity` — the gate that closes the silent-reject vector (THREAT_MODEL A11). Constructor `new_review_decision_event` + `ReviewDecisionPayload` in `events.rs`; emitted by `reject_proposal_in_frontier_signed` / `request_revision_in_frontier_signed` in `proposals.rs`. A reject is therefore now as accountable as an accept: same key custody, same signed log event, same replayability. Accepts continue to record their decision via the domain event they produce (`finding.asserted`, …), so no separate `review.accepted` is emitted on the standard accept path; the parity check recognizes an `applied` proposal's `applied_event_id` as its decision trace. |

Canonical `events` are the authoritative write log. Legacy `review_events` and
`confidence_updates` fields may be read for compatibility, but new v0 writes
should not rely on them as state authority.

### 6.0.1 Event-first hub projection

Network hubs preserve the canonical event array as ordered
`frontier_events` rows. The `(vfr_id, seq)` order must reproduce the
same `latest_event_log_hash` as the signed manifest. Query endpoints may
filter by kind or target, but the unfiltered cursor order is the
authoritative replay order.

Materialized frontier objects such as findings, sources, evidence atoms,
condition records, actors, negative results, trajectories, links, and
proposals are projections from a verified snapshot or from a replayed
event log. Snapshot JSON is a pull/export shape. It is not the network
authority source after promotion.

Historical backfills may use `authority_mode = "manifest_snapshot"`
when older events do not carry enough payload to replay genesis. In
that mode the signed manifest plus verified snapshot hash is the
authority bridge. New direct event writes must carry the full payload
needed for replay. In particular, `finding.asserted` must include
`payload.finding`.

### 6.1 NegativeResult lifecycle (v0.49)

A `NegativeResult` is a first-class kernel object parallel to
`FindingBundle`, identified by `vnr_<16hex>`. It records what was
tried and observed without flipping the confidence of any `Finding`
on its own; downstream confidence math reads the deposit and decides
what to revise. Two variants are discriminated by `kind.kind`:

- `registered_trial`: `endpoint`, `intervention`, `comparator`,
  `population`, `n_enrolled`, `power`, `effect_size_ci` (a 2-element
  `[lower, upper]` array), optional `effect_size_threshold` (the
  pre-registered MCID), optional `registry_id`.
- `exploratory`: `reagent`, `observation`, `attempts`.

Top-level NegativeResult fields: `id`, `kind`, `target_findings`
(optional `vf_*` ids the null bears against; cross-frontier
`vf_<id>@vfr_<id>` allowed), `deposited_by`, `conditions`
(reuses the `Conditions` shape), `provenance` (reuses the
`Provenance` shape), `created`, `notes`, optional `review_state`,
`retracted: bool`. Full schema: [`schema/negative-result.v0.1.0.json`](../schema/negative-result.v0.1.0.json).

**`negative_result.asserted` payload**:

```json
{
  "proposal_id": "vpr_<hex>",
  "negative_result": { "id": "vnr_<hex>", "kind": { ... }, "..." }
}
```

The full inline NegativeResult is carried on
`payload.negative_result` so a fresh `replay_from_genesis`
reconstructs `state.negative_results` from the canonical event log
alone. The reducer is idempotent on duplicate `vnr_id`s.

**`negative_result.reviewed` payload**:

```json
{
  "proposal_id": "vpr_<hex>",
  "status": "accepted" | "contested" | "needs_revision" | "rejected"
}
```

Targets a `vnr_*` via `event.target.id`. The reducer sets the
NegativeResult's `review_state` field; v0.49 does not flip a
`contested` flag the way `finding.reviewed` does because
NegativeResults don't carry the legacy `flags.contested` shim.

**`negative_result.retracted` payload**:

```json
{
  "proposal_id": "vpr_<hex>"
}
```

Targets a `vnr_*` and sets `retracted: true`. Replay of a frontier
with a later `negative_result.retracted` event reproduces the same
state regardless of how the live frontier reached it.

**Cross-implementation coverage.** The Rust, Python, and TypeScript
reducers all dispatch on these kinds. The cross-impl post-replay
digest (`fixture_coverage_includes_every_reducer_arm`) covers
finding-state only in v0.49, so TS and Python reducers may treat
the three `negative_result.*` kinds as no-ops on `Finding[]` state
without breaking the byte-equivalence promise. v0.50 tightens the
digest to include `negative_results` and requires all three
implementations to mirror the Rust apply functions.

**CLI**: `vela negative-result-add` deposits in one shot. Required
flags differ by `--kind`: `registered_trial` requires
`--endpoint`, `--intervention`, `--comparator`, `--population`,
`--n-enrolled`, `--power`, `--ci-lower`, `--ci-upper`;
`exploratory` requires `--reagent`, `--observation`, `--attempts`.
`vela negative-results <frontier>` lists deposits, optionally
filtered by `--target <vf_id>`.

### 6.2 Artifact lifecycle

`artifact.asserted` deposits a generic content-addressed artifact.

```json
{
  "proposal_id": "vpr_<hex>",
  "artifact": {
    "id": "va_<hex>",
    "kind": "clinical_trial_record",
    "name": "AHEAD 3-45 Study",
    "content_hash": "sha256:<64hex>",
    "storage_mode": "local_blob",
    "locator": ".vela/artifact-blobs/sha256/<hash>",
    "source_url": "https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04468659",
    "target_findings": ["vf_<hex>"],
    "metadata": {
      "nct_id": "NCT04468659",
      "overall_status": "ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING"
    },
    "access_tier": "public"
  }
}
```

Targets a `va_*` object and appends it to `Project.artifacts`.
`artifact.reviewed` sets `review_state`; `artifact.retracted` sets
`retracted: true`. `artifact.retract` is the human-gated proposal that emits
that event. Agents may draft it with `vela artifact retract`; only `vela sign`
may accept it. `tier.set` may also target artifacts.

**CLI**: `vela artifact-add` records a local or remote artifact.
`vela clinical-trial-import <frontier> <NCT_ID>` fetches a ClinicalTrials.gov v2
study record, stores a canonical JSON blob in `.vela/artifact-blobs/sha256/`
when the target is a `.vela` repo, and emits `artifact.asserted`.
`vela artifacts <frontier>` lists records, optionally filtered by
`--target <vf_id>`. `vela artifact-audit <frontier>` checks artifact
hashes, local blob sizes, target finding references, source locators,
access terms, and profile fields such as NCT ids for trial records.
The same report is exposed by `vela serve` at `/api/artifact-audit`.

`vela ingest <frontier> <packet.json> --actor <actor>` validates a
`carina.artifact_packet.v0.1` packet and writes reviewable proposals. Use
`--apply-artifacts` to accept only the content-addressed artifact records while
leaving candidate findings and gaps in the proposal inbox. `vela proposals
preview <frontier> <vpr_id>` applies one proposal to an in-memory clone and
reports count deltas without mutating the frontier.

`vela runtime-adapter run <frontier> <adapter> --input <file-or-dir>` is the
external-runtime bridge. It normalizes supported runtime exports into the same
artifact packet boundary, then reuses artifact-to-state review semantics.
`scienceclaw-artifact-v1` maps artifact DAG exports to artifact, finding, and
gap proposals. `agent-discourse-v1` maps post/comment/review exports to
artifact, finding, and review-note proposals.

### 6.3 Trajectory lifecycle (v0.50)

A `Trajectory` is the search path that produced (or did not
produce) a finding: hypotheses considered, branches tried,
branches ruled out and why. Identified by `vtr_<16hex>`, with steps
identified by `vts_<16hex>`. Steps are append-only, idempotent on
content-address. Full schema: [`schema/trajectory.v0.1.0.json`](../schema/trajectory.v0.1.0.json).

Top-level Trajectory fields: `id`, `target_findings` (optional
`vf_*` ids the search aimed at), `deposited_by`, `created`,
`steps`, `notes`, optional `review_state`, `retracted: bool`. The
trajectory id is fixed at creation
(`SHA-256(sorted_target_findings.join(",") | deposited_by | created)`)
so appending steps does not mint a new id.

Step fields: `id` (content-addressed
`SHA-256(parent_trajectory_id | kind.canonical() | normalize(description) | at | actor)`),
`kind` (`hypothesis | tried | ruled_out | observed | refined`),
`description`, `at`, `actor`, optional `references` (any kernel id:
`vf_*`, `vnr_*`, `vrep_*`, `vpred_*`, `vd_*`, `vc_*`).

**`trajectory.created` payload**:

```json
{
  "proposal_id": "vpr_<hex>",
  "trajectory": { "id": "vtr_<hex>", "target_findings": [...], "...": "..." }
}
```

The full inline Trajectory (with empty `steps`) is carried on
`payload.trajectory`. Idempotent on duplicate `vtr_id`.

**`trajectory.step_appended` payload**:

```json
{
  "proposal_id": "vpr_<hex>",
  "parent_trajectory_id": "vtr_<hex>",
  "step": { "id": "vts_<hex>", "kind": "ruled_out", "...": "..." }
}
```

Targets the parent trajectory's `vtr_id` via `event.target.id`.
Idempotent on duplicate `vts_id` so a replay of a partially-applied
log doesn't double-append.

**`trajectory.reviewed` payload** mirrors `negative_result.reviewed`:
`{ proposal_id, status: "accepted"|"contested"|"needs_revision"|"rejected" }`.

**`trajectory.retracted` payload**: `{ proposal_id }`. Sets
`retracted: true`.

**CLI**:
- `vela trajectory-create <frontier> --deposited-by ID --reason "…"
  [--target vf_…]* [--notes "…"]` opens a trajectory.
- `vela trajectory-step <frontier> <vtr_id> --kind hypothesis|tried|ruled_out|observed|refined
  --description "…" --actor ID --reason "…" [--reference vf_…|vnr_…|…]*`
  appends a step.
- `vela trajectories <frontier> [--target vf_id]` lists.

**Cross-implementation coverage**: same v0.49 → future digest
tightening pattern as NegativeResult. v0.50 ships the four kinds in
`REDUCER_MUTATION_KINDS` with Rust apply functions; cross-impl
fixture 06 exercises `created`, `step_appended`, `reviewed`, and
`retracted`.

### 6.4 Federation observation events

Frontier-level observations record what happened between hubs without
mutating finding state. Two kinds ship in v0.39 / v0.59:

- `frontier.conflict_detected` (v0.39): emitted per finding when a
  peer's view of the same `vf_*` diverges from ours. Required payload:
  `peer_id`, `finding_id`, `kind`. Validator arm at
  `crates/vela-protocol/src/events.rs::validate_payload` ("frontier.conflict_detected").
- `frontier.conflict_resolved` (v0.59): paired resolution event for an
  existing `frontier.conflict_detected`. Required payload:
  `conflict_event_id`, `resolved_by`, `resolution_note`. Optional:
  `winning_proposal_id`. The conflict event itself is never modified;
  the resolution is appended as a separate canonical event and paired
  on read by `conflict_event_id`. The proposal validator at
  `crates/vela-protocol/src/proposals.rs::validate` ("frontier.conflict_resolve")
  refuses a second resolution for an already-resolved conflict; the
  event-payload validator at `crates/vela-protocol/src/events.rs`
  enforces the required fields. The reducer arm at
  `crates/vela-protocol/src/reducer.rs` is a no-op on `Project.findings`
  for both kinds; consumers (Workbench inbox, audit scripts, hub
  mirrors) walk the event log to project paired status.

### 6.5 Bridge review (v0.67)

A `Bridge` (`vbr_*`) is a candidate cross-frontier link that a derive
pass identifies and a reviewer confirms or refutes. Pre-v0.67 the
status field was mutated by direct file write. v0.67 makes the verdict
a canonical event so federation sync can carry it.

`bridge.reviewed` payload:

```json
{
  "bridge_id": "vbr_<hex>",
  "status": "confirmed" | "refuted",
  "note": "optional reviewer note"
}
```

`event.target` is `{type: "bridge", id: "vbr_<hex>"}`. The reducer arm
is a no-op on `Project.findings`; the verdict projects onto
`Bridge.status` on read so the existing bridges projection picks it up
without additional state. `bridges derive` remains the path that mints
the original `derived` record; `bridge.reviewed` only records
`confirmed` or `refuted`. The CLI surface is `vela bridge confirm` and
`vela bridge refute`.

The signature-pure validator at
`crates/vela-protocol/src/events.rs:869-895` enforces `bridge_id`
prefix (`vbr_*`), `status` membership, and the optional `note` type. As
of v0.73 a state-aware second pass at
`validate_bridge_reviewed_against_state` (same module) rejects events
whose `bridge_id` is not present on the local frontier's bridge table.
The CLI emission path calls it before writing the event, so a
`bridges confirm` or `bridges refute` against a missing id fails fast
rather than landing an event nothing can project. Federation intake
paths that ingest `bridge.reviewed` events from peers should call the
state-aware validator with their local bridge id list before storing.

### 6.6 Replication and Prediction deposits (v0.70)

`Replication` (`vrep_*`) and `Prediction` (`vpred_*`) have been
first-class kernel objects on `Project.replications` and
`Project.predictions` since earlier releases, but the deposit was a
file-write side-table mutation. v0.70 makes both deposits
event-driven so federation sync can propagate them.

`replication.deposited` payload:

```json
{
  "replication": {
    "id": "vrep_<hex>",
    "...": "..."
  }
}
```

The reducer arm pushes the record onto `Project.replications` only if
the `vrep_*` id is not already present, so re-application of the same
event is a no-op. Pre-v0.70 frontiers with raw `vrep_*` entries on
`Project.replications` continue to load without an event.

`prediction.deposited` mirrors the shape against `Project.predictions`
and the `vpred_*` id space. Both deposits are reachable from the
Workbench review pages: `/review/replication-add/{finding_id}` and
`/review/prediction-add/{finding_id}` (added v0.71).

### 6.7 Proposal `drafted_at` (v0.67)

`StateProposal` carries an optional `drafted_at: Option<String>` field
documented at `crates/vela-protocol/src/proposals.rs:29-38`. When an
agent drafts a proposal long before the reviewer accepts it,
`drafted_at` records the draft moment and `created_at` records the
moment the proposal entered the canonical store. Throughput dashboards
read against `drafted_at` when present, falling back to `created_at`,
so the median proposal-to-event latency surfaces real reviewer queue
time rather than zero. The field is additive: pre-v0.67 proposals load
with `drafted_at: None` and round-trip byte-identically (the field is
serialized only when present).

### 6.8 Cross-hub conflict-resolution push (v0.70)

The `frontier.conflict_resolved` event kind remains valid and replays,
and the hub still accepts it over the cross-hub
`POST /entries/<vfr_id>/events` path documented below. The
`vela federation push-resolution` CLI verb that minted and pushed it
was removed in the v0.700 cut (see the removed-verbs banner); no
command in the current binary mints this event. The signed-event wire
surface — canonical preimage, Ed25519 auth headers, and verification
rules — remains the normative contract for any producer that
constructs the event directly: sign the canonical preimage with the
reviewer's Ed25519 key and POST it to the peer hub. The wire surface
follows.

Auth headers (the body omits the `signature` field so the bytes the
hub canonicalizes match the bytes the reviewer signed):

```
X-Vela-Signer-Pubkey: <64-hex-char Ed25519 pubkey>
X-Vela-Signature:     <128-hex-char Ed25519 signature>
```

Verification rules, applied in order, fail fast on the first
violation:

1. Headers present and well-formed (64 hex pubkey, 128 hex signature).
2. Body parses as a `StateEvent`.
3. The `vfr_id` in the URL resolves to a `live` frontier on this hub.
4. The pubkey resolves to a registered actor on the frontier.
5. `event.actor.id` matches the resolved actor.
6. Ed25519 signature verifies against the canonical preimage.
7. `event.kind` is `frontier.conflict_resolved`.
8. The paired `frontier.conflict_detected` event named by
   `payload.conflict_event_id` is already on the hub's log for this
   `vfr_id`.
9. No prior resolution exists for the same `conflict_event_id` under
   a different event id.

Response codes:

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `202 Accepted` | Event appended; response body carries the assigned `seq`. |
| `200 OK` | Idempotent re-push: same canonical event id already on the log; response carries `duplicate=true`. |
| `401 Unauthorized` | Pubkey not registered as an actor, or signature does not verify. |
| `403 Forbidden` | Event kind is not `frontier.conflict_resolved`. |
| `409 Conflict` | A different resolution event already pairs with the same `conflict_event_id`. |
| `422 Unprocessable Entity` | Paired `frontier.conflict_detected` not found on this hub. |

v0 remains proposal/event/finding centered.

### 6.9 Release history

This list tracks protocol-surface additions across recent releases.
Earlier releases are documented inline in the sections above.

- **v0.759.3**: generated agent guidance defines the full Vela release contract
  as the deterministic protocol, frontier, internal Lean, and external Lean
  suites. Live-network and platform-pinned Diderot checks remain explicit
  integration certifications, so a replaceable complementor cannot become an
  unrelated Vela release dependency. No event, receipt, decision, or authority
  schema changed.
- **v0.759.2**: the installed external-Lean verifier bundle is wholly contained
  in the publishable `vela-cli` crate. Public-clone and package checks prevent
  release builds from reaching into a parent campaign checkout. Git publication
  also pins attribute lookup to the verified target commit, preventing mutable
  worktree filters from entering exact preflight, publication, or recovery.
  Shipped agent guidance distinguishes changed-path deterministic checks from
  the compatible-host full release union. No event, receipt, decision, or
  authority schema changed.
- **v0.759.1**: sandbox process-group cleanup checks quiescence before signaling
  a post-wait PGID, absorbs macOS `EPERM` only as a bounded cleanup condition,
  samples only the sandbox process group, and tolerates only a 250 ms continuous
  host-monitor outage before failing closed. Descendants must still quiesce. No
  event, receipt, decision, or authority schema changed.
- **v0.759.0**: new decisions bind an exact private Decision Plan root into the
  existing signed acceptance event while legacy events remain replayable;
  Receipt v1 producer context may carry a namespaced task-contract root; the
  task-first CLI uses one ignored typed work session, shared receipt landing,
  and signed zero-TTL lease release; the installed external-Lean command and
  derived packet decision view ship with conformance fixtures. Decision Brief
  and packet-view schemas remain testing contracts, not authority objects.
- **v0.67**: `bridge.reviewed` event (§6.5); `StateProposal.drafted_at` optional field (§6.7).
- **v0.68**: internal hardening; no new event kinds or schema fields.
- **v0.69**: internal hardening; no new event kinds or schema fields.
- **v0.70**: `replication.deposited` and `prediction.deposited` events (§6.6); the `frontier.conflict_resolved` cross-hub push surface (§6.8). *(The `vela federation`, replication, and prediction CLI verbs were retired in the v0.700 cut; the event kinds remain valid in replay — see the removed-verbs banner.)*
- **v0.71**: Workbench review surfaces `/review/replication-add/{finding_id}` and `/review/prediction-add/{finding_id}` for the v0.70 deposit events.
- **v0.72**: cross-impl fixture coverage for v0.67 to v0.71 events; `docs/PROTOCOL.md` backfill; `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `clients/python/README.md` added.
- **v0.73**: `bridge.reviewed` validator gains `validate_bridge_reviewed_against_state` for state-aware tightening (§6.5); cross-impl JSON fixture export extended to cover v0.67 to v0.71 event kinds; developer walkthrough of the event log (now §The canonical event log).

## 6b. activity records (v0)

An **activity record** (`vela.activity-record.v0.1`, id `vrc_` +
sha256(canonical body, id="")[:16]) is the portable claim packet: a
structured PROPOSAL to change frontier state that any workbench — an AI
agent, a notebook, an HPC job, a lab system — can record and any carrier
(a PR, an artifact store, an email) can move. It lives in the ACTIVITY
plane (the claim-centric sibling of the action-centric ActivityEnvelope):
a record is not truth; it is activity shaped so the merge layer can judge
it.

Required structure:

- `frontier_id` (`vfr_`) and `against_head` — the `event_log_hash` at emit
  time, so the reviewer sees exactly how stale the claim is;
- `assertion` + `assertion_type` (`theoretical | computational | empirical
  | negative`);
- `artifacts[]` — at least one, each with `kind`, `locator`, and a
  `sha256` the validator re-derives from bytes (a record cannot cite what
  it cannot show);
- `caveats[]` — at least one non-empty statement of what the claim does
  NOT establish;
- `emitted_by` — any actor; agents welcome (recording is proposing, never
  deciding);
- `signature` — optional Ed25519 over the canonical body
  (`application/vnd.vela.activity_record+json` under the signing facade).
  An unsigned record is valid and loudly reported as `signed=false`. An
  agent-actor record never auto-resolves a configured human key: it signs
  only with a key passed explicitly, or not at all.

Lifecycle: `vela land <frontier> --claim …` (or `vela land <receipt.json>`)
hashes the artifacts, pins the head, validates (schema, id re-derivation,
signature, every artifact hash), and lands a `finding.add` proposal — then
routes it by the signed policy: Permit admits, Defer parks it in the sign
queue, and Deny refuses canonical admission. Until the transactional write
edge lands, clients must inspect the structured result for any retained draft
state rather than assume a zero-delta Deny. Landing NEVER accepts; a deferred
decision stays a human-keyed act at `vela sign`. `git push` publishes and the hub
re-derives its index.

## 7. storage layout

The portable baseline remains monolithic `frontier.json`.

The default cloneable frontier repository format is:

```text
my-frontier/
├── README.md
├── SCOPE.md
├── frontier.yaml
├── frontier.json
├── vela.lock
├── sources/
├── artifacts/
├── review/
├── proof/
├── exports/
└── .vela/
```

In split frontier repos, `.vela/events/` is the append-only machine authority.
`frontier.json` is the materialized clone/read entrypoint. `proof/` is the
visible verification surface. `vela.lock` records the snapshot, event-log,
proposal-state, kernel, reducer, source, artifact, review, and proof hashes
that prove the visible state matches the event history.

### 7.1 Manifest dependencies (v0.59)

`frontier.yaml::dependencies` carries the durable cross-frontier
dependency declarations for split repos. The pre-v0.59 shape kept three
flat string lists (`frontiers`, `packages`, `adapters`); the v0.59
addition is `frontiers_v2: Vec<ProjectDependency>`, which records full
`ProjectDependency` entries (vfr id, locator, pinned snapshot hash, kind)
inline in the manifest. See `crates/vela-protocol/src/frontier_repo.rs`
(`ManifestDependencies::frontiers_v2`).

The field closes a split-repo loader gap: pre-v0.59, `vela frontier
add-dep` writes landed in the rendered `frontier.json` only, and
`vela frontier materialize` regenerated that file without them.
`frontiers_v2` is the durable source of truth in the yaml manifest and
is rehydrated into `Project.dependencies` on load. The field is
additive: pre-v0.59 manifests load with `frontiers_v2: []` and round-trip
unchanged; the renderer skips serialization when the list is empty.

A `.vela` repository may also store frontier state as files:

```text
.vela/
  config.toml
  findings/
    vf_{hash}.json
  events/
    vev_{hash}.json
  proposals/
    vpr_{hash}.json
  proof-state.json
```

Older repositories may include split link manifests, review projection files,
confidence-update projection files, runs, or trails. Those are compatibility or
roadmap artifacts, not required v0 public storage.

## 8. proof packet contract

`vela proof` exports a review packet from frontier state without modifying the
input frontier by default. `--record-proof-state` may be used for local
bookkeeping after successful packet validation. Required packet families
include:

- manifest, overview, scope, packet lock, and RO-Crate metadata
- full findings
- source registry, evidence atoms, and source/evidence map
- condition records and condition matrix
- candidate gaps, bridges, tensions, review queue, and signals
- canonical events and replay report
- a derived decision view containing the exact authority event or policy
  certificate, roots, scope, relations, and replay command
- proposals
- artifact manifest, artifact audit, and checked local artifact blob map
- proof trace

`packet validate` checks packet integrity, lifecycle-aware artifact counts,
active artifact audit status, and active local artifact blob hashes. Historical
issues must name retracted artifacts and remain visible without carrying
current proof-readiness weight. Proof freshness relative to later accepted
frontier writes is tracked in frontier state when proof state has been recorded.

`decisions/decision-view.json` is derived and validated against
`events/events.json`. It is not a second decision object. The signed event or
policy certificate remains authority, and legacy events report an unavailable
decision root rather than receiving a synthetic one. See
[`INTEROPERABILITY.md`](INTEROPERABILITY.md).

## 9. derived signals

Signals are recomputed from frontier state. They include proof readiness, review
queues, candidate gaps, candidate bridges, candidate tensions, observer-policy
rerankings, and simulated retraction impact over declared dependency links.

Signals are not standalone scientific facts.

## 10. conformance

> The guarantee ⇄ proof ⇄ conformance triangle (every load-bearing invariant mapped to its
> normative clause here, its machine-checked Lean theorem, and its conformance vector) is in
> [`THEORY.md`](THEORY.md) Appendix B. Two interoperating implementations
> (Rust reference + Python reducer) agree on the vectors.

A conforming v0 implementation must:

1. Read and write finding bundles matching `finding-bundle.v0.2.0.json`.
2. Generate content-addressed IDs using the v0 pre-image rules.
3. Compute confidence from structured evidence fields.
4. Preserve source/evidence/condition boundaries.
5. Preserve disagreement through typed links and review state.
6. Use proposal-first writes for truth-changing state changes.
7. Store canonical events as the authoritative transition log.
8. Validate replay and proof freshness for proof-facing output.
9. Support monolithic frontier JSON and Git-compatible `.vela` layout.
10. Preserve read compatibility for legacy review/confidence fields where
    practical.

A conforming implementation should expose machine-readable check/proof/serve
contracts and keep candidate signals caveated.

The full third-party conformance procedure (what is public, how to run the
suite, what a conformant report does and does not assert) is in §Conformance
below.

## 11. Non-Normative roadmap boundary

The larger theory includes runtime, network propagation, and constellated
coordination. Vela v0 only standardizes the state kernel. Future object families
or network behavior must be promoted through the same discipline: replay,
writeback, proof/export, review, and merge semantics first.

## 13. Access tiers (v0.51)

The dual-use deposition channel. Three read-side tiers, ordered by
sensitivity:

- `public` (default): open read.
- `restricted`: readers need an `ActorRecord` with
  `access_clearance >= restricted`. The IBC review level: dual-use
  research that the host institution has declared subject to
  incident-response review but not capability-gated.
- `classified`: readers need
  `access_clearance == classified`. Aligned with the federal DURC
  framework and the capability gates frontier AI labs already
  publish under their own safety frameworks (Anthropic's Responsible
  Scaling Policy, OpenAI's Preparedness Framework, Google
  DeepMind's Frontier Safety Framework). Content above those
  internal thresholds is excluded from public deposit entirely; the
  substrate's openness default fails closed on ambiguous cases,
  with the operational cost borne by depositors.

The composition risk, capability uplift from aggregation across the
dependency graph rather than any single deposit, is the harder
problem and v0.51 does not claim to solve it. Treating it as solved
would be the wrong move. v0.51 carries the per-object tier; the
composition graph is a follow-up.

### 13.1 Where the tier lives

Each of the three load-bearing claim objects carries an
`access_tier` field:

- `FindingBundle.access_tier`
- `NegativeResult.access_tier`
- `Trajectory.access_tier`

Default is `public`. The field is **NOT** part of the
content-address preimage; re-classifying an object does not mint
a new id. Pre-v0.51 frontiers load with the default and round-trip
byte-identically (skip-if-public).

`ActorRecord` carries an `access_clearance: Option<AccessTier>`.
Pre-v0.51 actors load with `None`, equivalent to public-only access.

### 13.2 `tier.set` lifecycle event

Re-classification is replay-deterministic. Payload:

```json
{
  "proposal_id": "vpr_<hex>",
  "object_type": "finding" | "negative_result" | "trajectory",
  "object_id": "vf_<hex>" | "vnr_<hex>" | "vtr_<hex>",
  "previous_tier": "public" | "restricted" | "classified",
  "new_tier":      "public" | "restricted" | "classified"
}
```

`event.target.{type,id}` mirrors `payload.{object_type, object_id}`.
The reducer locates the matched object and mutates its
`access_tier`. `previous_tier` is recorded in the payload so a
downstream auditor reading the event log can reconstruct the full
classification history without re-deriving it from prior state.

### 13.3 Read gating in `vela serve`

The Rust HTTP/MCP server resolves the requesting actor's clearance
from an `X-Vela-Actor` request header, looks the actor up in
`Project.actors`, and applies `access_tier::redact_for_actor`
before serializing.

- Anonymous reads (header absent) get `None`, equivalent to
  public-only.
- `GET /entries/self/findings/<id>` returns `404` when the finding's
  tier exceeds the actor's clearance; the existence of the object is
  itself part of the tiered content.
- `GET /entries/self/findings` returns a redacted view:
  above-clearance findings, negative_results, trajectories, and any
  events targeting them are dropped from the response.

This is a deliberately thin authentication surface for v0.51: a
real deployment terminates TLS and validates actor signatures at a
reverse proxy, then forwards `X-Vela-Actor` only when verified.
v0.52+ can tighten this to require a signed bearer token end-to-end.

### 13.4 CLI

```bash
# Register an actor with read-side clearance
vela actor add my-frontier.json reviewer:ibc \
  --pubkey "$(cat keys/public.key)" \
  --clearance restricted

# Re-classify an existing finding
vela tier-set my-frontier.json \
  --object-type finding \
  --object-id  vf_<hex> \
  --tier       restricted \
  --actor      reviewer:ibc \
  --reason     "Subject to IBC review; gain-of-function adjacent."
```

### 13.5 What v0.51 does NOT solve

- **Composition risk.** The per-object tier protects single
  deposits. Aggregation across the dependency graph could leak
  capability uplift even when each individual object is below the
  classification threshold. v0.51.x will model this; today the
  substrate flags the gap rather than papering over it.
- **Federation propagation.** When a frontier with restricted
  objects syncs to a peer hub, what happens to the redaction is
  not yet specified. v0.51 ships with the local read gate only.
- **Audit-trail tiering.** The `tier.set` event itself is currently
  public. A future revision can elevate the event payload to the
  same tier as the object it reclassifies if the act of
  classification is itself sensitive.

---

## 14. Changelog from v0.73.0

v0.73.0 was the substrate-completeness cut. The kernel below
that mark stayed shape-stable; the cycles that landed since
add primitives, surfaces, and machine-checked guarantees
without changing the canonical-event preimage or replay
rules. Material additions, in cycle order:

- v0.74: top-level alias verbs (`init / ingest / propose /
  diff / accept / attest / log / lineage / serve`) and the
  README six-step demo.
- v0.75: Carina v0.3 spec deliverable plus the `Proof`
  primitive; bundled JSON Schemas at
  `examples/carina-kernel/schemas/`.
- v0.78: `Atlas` (`vat_<id>`) primitive in Carina v0.4.
- v0.80: `Constellation` (`vco_<id>`) primitive in Carina
  v0.5; per-event `attestation.recorded` event kind.
- v0.83: discord detectors (`evidence_gap`,
  `provenance_fragile`, `status_divergent`) over the live
  event log.
- v0.85: BelnapStatus surfaced in the Workbench. Per-finding
  Belnap letter (N / T / F / B) derived deterministically
  from the support set.
- v0.86: ancestor_closure primitive wired into federation
  divergence reports.
- v0.88: provenance polynomial structure in the API.
- v0.89: `schema_artifact_id` additive on `StateEvent`.
- v0.90: five substrate theorems machine-checked in Lean 4
  (Theorems 1 to 5, replay convergence + provenance
  retraction monotonicity + status-provenance soundness +
  detector monotonicity to frontier upward closure +
  hash-DAG log integrity). See `lean/Vela/`.
- v0.91: README-demo gate scripts/test-readme-demo.sh.
- v0.92: `POST /api/proposals/from-carina` agent
  write-target. (Retired.)
- v0.94: public conformance contract at `conformance/`.
- v0.95: `vela discord` aggregate CLI. (Retired.)
- v0.96: replay perf characterized at O(N^2); deferred to
  v0.105.
- v0.97: `/api/discord` HTTP endpoint mirroring CLI. (Retired.)
- v0.99: mixed-folder ingest dispatches every content type
  in stable order (notes / scout / data) with an unhandled-
  extension warn line.
- v0.100: publish-pull round-trip exercised end-to-end
  against the live hub. (The publish/pull transport is retired,
  ADR 0001 Phase 2; publication is `git push`.)
- v0.101: `vela registry publish` auto-registers the owner
  actor when the actors set is empty. (`registry publish` is
  retired; see v0.720+.)
- v0.102: ingest-doi hint plus README path-precedence note;
  full crates.io + PyPI publish round (v0.102 is the first
  published binary that matches repo state since v0.77).
  actor add + finding add in one shot.
- v0.104: multi-sig kernel correctness fix.
  `sign::canonical_json` strips
  `flags.jointly_accepted` from the signing preimage so
  the v0.37 threshold flow is verifiable end-to-end;
  `verify_frontier_data` iterates every signed envelope
  individually so multi-sig findings report all distinct
  signers. Byte-compatible with every existing on-disk
  signature because `jointly_accepted=false` was already
  skip-serialized.
- v0.105: O(N) replay via per-replay finding-id index in
  the reducer. The v0.96-deferred optimization landed.
  Public `apply_event` signature unchanged; replay loop
  uses the new `apply_event_indexed`.

Per-cycle session logs are internal working notes and are
not vendored in this distribution.

## State integrity and impact

Vela separates structural correctness from scientific incompleteness.

Accepted events are the append-only authority. Materialized frontier JSON is the
replay output. A proposal can be pending, accepted, rejected, or held for
revision, but it does not become trusted frontier state until an accepted event
exists and replay agrees with the materialized state.

The protocol exposes one read-only structural check:

```bash
vela check <FRONTIER> --strict [--json]
```

`vela check --strict` reports duplicate event ids, orphan event targets, replay
conflicts, accepted proposals without applied events, accepted events without
proposal ids, stale proof state, and accepted artifact proposals that lack a
source locator or content hash.

Downstream-dependent analysis (formerly `vela impact`) lives in the graph
surfaces: the `blast_radius` MCP tool reports declared dependents for a
finding across `supports`, `depends`, `contradicts`, and cross-frontier
targets, and the hub serves reverse deps at `GET /entries/{vfr_id}/depends-on`.
Both are non-mutating and do not change confidence.

## The minimal core: six primitives of mathematical state change

The six generic primitives below constitute the mechanics of accepted
mathematical state. A second producer reads exactly these. This was the doc of
record for Workstream 0 (the aggressive minimal core).

> Freeze means two things only: a stable identity + wire contract, and a conformance test that
> fails if the contract moves. It does not mean new abstraction. Promotion of a domain noun to a
> generic type happens when a live consumer forces it, never speculatively. The Attempt Packet and
> ProducerRef below were promoted because the H1 ablation (Workstream A) needed a producer-agnostic
> attempt; that is the pattern.

### The six

#### 1. Frontier
- **Is:** a unit of governed accepted state, identified by `frontier_id`, whose accepted content
  is a pure function of its signed event log. `roots` / `snapshot_hash` address the materialized
  view. (`project.rs`, `frontier_repo.rs`.)
- **Frozen contract:** the `frontier_id` and the genesis-rooted log identify the frontier; the
  materialized view is reproducible from the log alone; no field of the accepted view is authored
  out of band.
- **Pinned by:** `vela reproduce` + `vela frontier materialize` byte-identical on every committed
  frontier; the executable no-hidden-state law (`conformance/vela_no_hidden_state_check.py`); the
  finite-ranked kernel fixture (`conformance/vela_v09_sidon_kernel_fixture.py`).

#### 2. StateTransition
- **Is:** a single signed event appended to a frontier's log and applied by the reducer. This is
  the ONLY way accepted state changes. (`events.rs`, `reducer.rs`.)
- **Frozen contract:** the reducer is a pure left fold over the event sequence; an event's `id`
  hashes its `after_hash`; canonical JSON is presence-sensitive, so the wire shape is part of the
  contract. Two independent reducer implementations must agree bit-for-bit on the derived state.
- **Pinned by:** the cross-implementation reducer fixtures (`conformance/fixtures/`, Rust ==
  Python finding-state digest, gate step `gate-conformance-py-rust`); canonical hashing vectors
  (`conformance/canonical-hashing.json`, `verify_canonical_hashing.py`).

#### 3. Witness record
- **Is:** a content-addressed witness that a verification or retrieval happened: a
  `VerifierAttachment`, a signed manifest, a witness blob under `vela-verify`. Provenance, not a
  verdict; registering a witness never accepts a claim. (The portable claim
  packet built on this contract is the activity record, §6b.)
- **Frozen contract:** a witness record addresses exact bytes (the witness / manifest), and re-checking
  those bytes under the frozen verifier reproduces the same pass/fail. A witness record carries no trust
  weight on its own; acceptance is a separate key-custody event.
- **Pinned by:** `vela reproduce` (every witness re-checks under the frozen `vela-verify`);
  canonical hashing vectors for the content addresses.

#### 4. Replay
- **Is:** loading a frontier IS replaying its log IS reducing it. `reducer::replay_from_genesis`
  + `verify_replay`. (`reducer.rs`.)
- **Frozen contract:** loader == reducer (no separate read path that could drop state);
  deterministic across runs and implementations; the determinism guarantee is the frozen one the
  rest of the core rests on.
- **Pinned by:** `conformance/vela_no_hidden_state_check.py` (the executable Conformance Law);
  `vela reproduce`; `verify_replay` tests.

#### 5. Task
- **Is:** a unit of producible work: a target obligation on a base frontier root. Today it is
  realized for one profile (`vtk_` in `sidon_profile/producer.rs`); the Attempt Packet (below)
  carries `target_obligation_id`, `statement_variant_id`, `base_frontier_root` generically.
- **Frozen contract (for the Sidon profile; generic Task packet promotion deferred to Workstream
  B):** a task names a target on a specific base frontier root, so what a producer is asked to do
  is pinned to the state it consumed.
- **Pinned by:** the Sidon producer profile + kernel fixture. The generic Task type is promoted
  when a second producer class needs it (the forcing-function discipline), not before.

#### 6. Producer
- **Is:** the agent that reads a frontier root and emits an Attempt. Identified by
  `ProducerRef { system, version, config_digest }`. The Attempt Packet (`base_frontier_root`,
  `target_obligation_id`, `statement_variant_id`, `method_families`, `remaining_obligations`,
  `named_obstructions`, `producer`) is the normalized output. (`attempt.rs`, promoted in WS-A1.)
- **Frozen contract:** an Attempt is content-addressed (`vat_`) and key-independent (the id does
  not depend on who signed it); the packet fields are additive and `skip_serializing_if` empty, so
  a legacy attempt's `vat_` is unchanged (byte-safe promotion); `base_frontier_root` pins the
  attempt to the state it consumed, which is the spine of the retained-producer loop and the H1
  ablation.
- **Pinned by:** `conformance/attempt-id.json` + `verify_attempt_id.py` (cross-impl `vat_`);
  the `packet_fields_round_trip_and_legacy_id_is_stable` unit test.

### Deliberately NOT promoted (domain vocabulary stays local)

`Problem`, `StatementVariant`, `Formalization`, `Obstruction`, `Bridge` remain domain nouns in
the Sidon profile and the Erdős data. They are promoted to generic types only when the ablation
or a second producer forces it (Workstream B/C). Promoting them now would be the founder
abstraction trap: refining the description ahead of a consumer. The bar for promotion is a live
second consumer, the same bar that promoted ProducerRef and the Attempt Packet.

### Why this is enough

The six primitives are what a producer must understand to read state, do work, and submit it:
a Frontier to read, a Task to attempt, a Producer identity to attempt as, an Attempt that becomes
a StateTransition once accepted, a Receipt as the evidence, and Replay as the guarantee that what
they read is exactly what is true. Each is pinned by a test that fails if its contract moves. No
AI sits in any trust path: a Receipt is provenance, acceptance of a StateTransition is a
key-custody human decision, and replay determinism is what makes both checkable by anyone.

## Vela invariants

The substrate invariants below matter for implementation. They are narrower than
`docs/THEORY.md` and more operational.

Vela is not a new branch of mathematics. It is a protocol discipline:
scientific activity becomes durable only when it is converted into reviewed,
attested, replayable frontier state.

The implementation center is:

```text
source artifact / agent run / lab result / review comment
-> proposal
-> diff
-> review
-> accepted event
-> deterministic replay
-> changed frontier state
-> changed answer, graph, benchmark, or proof packet
```

The primitive is not a paper. The primitive is not a standalone claim. The
primitive is a reviewed state transition over scoped frontier state.

### Invariant 1. Replay convergence

If two replicas have the same valid accepted events, schemas, reducer, and
referenced artifacts, replay must produce the same frontier state.

```text
same valid events + same reducer + same schemas + same artifacts
=> same frontier state
```

Product obligation:

- accepted events are append-only history
- canonical replay order is deterministic
- proof packets record event-log and snapshot hashes
- stale proof state is visible after accepted events

Current implementation:

- canonical events live in frontier state and split `.vela/events`
- `vela check --strict` checks replay consistency and proof freshness
- proof packets include replay and snapshot commitments

### Invariant 2. Activity is not state

Papers, notes, datasets, benchmark outputs, agent traces, lab runs, and review
comments are source material. They do not mutate trusted frontier state by
being present.

```text
artifact != state
agent output != truth
accepted event = state transition
```

Product obligation:

- agent outputs compile into proposals or source records
- truth-changing writes require review
- source lake records remain upstream until accepted events land

Current implementation:

- research traces, source-lake records, benchmark outputs, and source packets
  are source artifacts or projections
- trusted updates move through readiness, event return, materialization, and
  canonicalization packets before mutating frontier state

### Invariant 3. Context preservation

A finding is incomplete without the context that bounds it.

```text
assertion alone is invalid state
finding = assertion + evidence + conditions + confidence + provenance + review
```

Narrow support does not automatically generalize.

```text
supported(mouse, dose, assay) does not imply supported(human treatment)
```

Product obligation:

- condition records must remain visible
- high confidence with weak scope is a quality risk
- translation claims must name model system, endpoint, and comparator limits

Current implementation:

- finding bundles carry conditions, evidence, confidence, provenance, links,
  flags, and annotations
- proof packets include condition and evidence projections
- strict checks and review packets surface source and condition debt

### Invariant 4. Contradiction preservation

Contradiction is frontier signal. It must not be averaged away into one score.

```text
support(q, c) and refute(q, c) => discord(q, c)
```

Product obligation:

- conflicting evidence remains inspectable
- counterweight findings stay in answer paths
- graph views show load-bearing claims and tensions

Current implementation:

- typed links, contested flags, caveats, candidate tensions, and graph
  neighborhoods preserve disagreement
- full Belnap and discord semantics are substrate direction, not the whole
  current public product contract

### Invariant 5. Provenance cannot be invented

Restriction, filtering, or retraction may remove support. It must not create
new support.

```text
support(after restriction) is a subset of support(before restriction)
```

Product obligation:

- every accepted state transition must name why it stands
- retractions and source repair events preserve history
- downstream impact is computed from declared dependencies

Theory direction:

- provenance semirings model alternative and joint support paths
- a retraction substitutes killed support variables with zero
- if every support path dies, the finding cannot remain supported

Current implementation:

- events carry before and after hashes
- proof packets carry source, evidence, review, and replay projections
- retraction impact exists as simulated dependency propagation

### Invariant 6. Projections are not canonical state

Search, graph views, dashboards, summaries, rankings, benchmark tables, and
answer pages are projections over replayed frontier state.

```text
canonical state = deterministic replay of accepted events
projection = rebuildable view over canonical state
```

Product obligation:

- dashboards must point back to findings, evidence, events, and proof state
- graph and answer pages cannot become hidden truth stores
- benchmark results must name their source and scoring boundary

Current implementation:

- site pages read frontier-owned JSON packets and proof artifacts
- release packets include machine-reader paths to projection artifacts
- benchmark ledgers separate local scoring from broad outperformance claims

### Invariant 7. Usefulness is an empirical claim

The substrate theory is only useful if it improves work on a real frontier.

For the Erdős/Sidon frontier, the near-term proof is:

```text
hard open-problem question
-> Vela answer
-> evidence/source trail
-> caveats and counterweights
-> graph neighborhood
-> accepted state-transition history
-> benchmark comparison
-> proof packet
```

Product obligation:

- flagship answer paths must be understandable without reading raw JSON
- benchmark rows must compare against a named baseline
- at least one answer path should show how accepted state transitions changed
  what the frontier says

Current implementation:

- the Sidon/Erdős frontier has verifier-checked witness paths, current-bound
  synthesis against the OEIS baseline, graph explanation, benchmark packets,
  source readiness packets, accepted trusted-update events, canonical caveat
  events, and fresh proof state
- the remaining work is to make this loop impossible to miss in the product
  and to strengthen the benchmark with live or outsider-scored comparisons

## ID prefix registry

Every content-addressed object in the substrate carries a short
`v*_` prefix in front of its hex digest. This section is the authoritative
meaning of each live prefix. Prefixes are load-bearing: they appear
inside signed preimages and stored event logs, so **live prefixes are
never renamed**; collisions are documented here as known debt instead.

The naming dictionary in the frontier-calculus writeup defers to this
table.

| `vop_` | owner-rotate proposal |
| `vab_` | owner-rotate attestation bundle |
| `vrc_` | activity record (`record.rs`; a retired registry-checkpoint writer historically shared this prefix) |
| `vac_` | actor handle |
| `vsi_` | search index |

### Composition handles (Carina spec tier)

| prefix | object |
|---|---|
| `vat_` | Carina **atlas** primitive (see collision below) |
| `vct_` / `vco_` | Carina constellation primitive (`vct_` in the handle resolver, `vco_` in the schema) |

### Known collisions (documented debt, do not rename)

1. **`vat_`, attempt vs. Carina atlas.** The authoritative protocol
   sense is the *attempt* (`attempt.rs`, signed deposits verified by
   `vela attempt`). The Carina spec tier reuses `vat_` for the atlas
   primitive (`embedded/carina-schemas/atlas.schema.json`), and the handle resolver
   (`resolver.rs`) still maps bare `vat_<hex>` handles to atlas URLs.
   Both are live (attempts in the event log; atlas in the shipped
   Carina schema set), so neither side can be renamed without breaking
   stored ids. Treat bare-`vat_` handle resolution as ambiguous.

2. **`vtr_`, transfer vs. trajectory.** The authoritative (and now
   only live) sense is the *cross-domain transfer* (`transfer.rs`,
   verified by `vela transfer`). The trajectory object was fully retired
   in v0.700 (its type, `trajectory.*` event kinds, schema, and MCP tool
   are all gone), but historical logs still contain `vtr_` trajectory
   ids minted before the cut, so the prefix cannot be cleanly reclaimed.
   Any newly-minted `vtr_` is a transfer; a `vtr_` inside a legacy
   `.vela/trajectories/` file or an old `trajectory.*` event is a
   retired trajectory id.

3. **`vsa_` vs. `vatt_`, two attestations.** Not an id collision but a
   recurring vocabulary trap: `vsa_` is the *statement* attestation
   (does the formal statement faithfully encode the informal problem),
   `vatt_` is the *reviewer identity* attestation. The bare word
   "attestation" is banned in spec prose; always qualify as
   "statement attestation (`vsa_`)" or "reviewer attestation
   (`vatt_`)". (`vaa_` agent attestations and `vab_` owner-rotate
   bundles are further, distinct attestation-shaped objects.)

## Status planes: the canonical vocabulary map

Vela speaks about a record on **four distinct planes**. Each is a separate,
legitimate projection over the same replayed state. They share some words
("open", "contested", "disproved"/"refuted"), and that overlap is the single
biggest source of vocabulary drift. This section is the canonical map: what
each plane means, what type carries it, which surface shows it, and the rule
that governs how they relate.

**The governing rule:** the planes are projections, not synonyms. They can
disagree by design, and Vela never collapses them into one scalar "confidence"
(memo §8, §16.5). A surface must always make clear *which plane* it is showing.

### Plane 1: Resolution (descriptive, cross-source)

What the **source databases declare** about a problem. This is a join over what
others say, not a Vela verdict.

- Words: `open` · `proved` · `solved` · `disproved` · `contested` · `undeclared`
- Type: `atlas::AtlasCell.status` (substrate), `AtlasStatus` (web `lib/atlas.ts`)
- Surfaced on: the **Map** (state lens, labelled "cross-database resolution"),
  the **Concordance**
- Authority: none. `contested` here means the sources disagree on the
  resolution word; it is a reconciliation queue, not an adjudication.

### Plane 2: Finding state (product, per-finding, derived)

The **platform's own read of a single finding**, derived from its review verdict
plus its recomputed verifier gate. This is the product vocabulary (memo §6):
what the UI says *about a finding*.

- Words: `open` · `established` · `refuted` · `contested` · `fragile`
- Type: `frontier_graph::FindingState`
- Surfaced on: the **Boundary** tab, the per-frontier claim **graph**
- Authority: derived, recomputed on read. `established` = reviewer-accepted OR
  a passing verifier-gate attachment; `fragile` = established but thin;
  `refuted` = a rejected verdict or a gate refutation; `contested` = a contested
  verdict or a recorded contradiction. Orthogonal to Plane 1: a problem can be
  Resolution=`disproved` (a source says so) while its Finding state is `open`
  (Vela holds no review verdict or attachment for it yet). That is not a
  contradiction; it is two planes.

### Plane 3: Epistemic support (formal, provenance)

The **bilattice/Belnap status** computed from the support and refute provenance
polynomials and their exact κ coordinates. The formal trust calculus underneath
the product words.

- Words: `True` · `False` · `Both` · `None` (Belnap corners); the graded
  support / refutation κ interior is a reference model, not computed in the
  runtime (THEORY.md §40)
- Type: `status_provenance::BelnapStatus`
- Surfaced on: `vela state`; the trust internals
- Authority: a pure function of the recorded support/refute monomials
  (Theorem 3). Never persisted. `Both` here is the formal join of support and
  refutation, which is *not* the same event as a Plane-2 `contested` review
  verdict.

### Plane 4: Review lifecycle / protocol signals (process)

Where a **change** sits in the propose → review → accept → seal pipeline, and the
protocol event signals. About the *process*, not the claim's truth.

- Words: `raw` · `proposed` · `reviewed` · `accepted` · `banked` · `sealed` ·
  `contested` · `retracted` · `leased` · `replayed` (and the rest of
  `lib/signal-code.ts`)
- Type: web `signal-code` / `StateChip`; substrate `review.*` events,
  `StateProposal.status`
- Authority: the signed event log. `contested` here is a review *event*, the
  upstream of a Plane-2 contested finding.

### Shared-word table (always qualify by plane)

| word | Plane 1 Resolution | Plane 2 Finding state | Plane 3 Epistemic | Plane 4 Lifecycle |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| open | sources record no resolution | no verdict/gate yet | — | — |
| contested | sources disagree | contested verdict / contradiction | `Both` corner | a review event |
| disproved / refuted | a source recorded a refutation | rejected verdict or gate refutation | `False` corner | — |
| proved / solved / established | a source recorded a proof/solution | reviewer-accepted or gate-verified | `True` corner | `accepted`/`sealed` |

When writing copy or a label, name the plane: "cross-database resolution"
(Plane 1), "finding state" (Plane 2), "support" (Plane 3), "review" (Plane 4).
Never let a bare word imply all four.

### Domain terms that are NOT status words

- **"Erdős Problem #N"** is a domain proper noun (the problem's name). It stays
  in finding *content*; it is not the Plane-1 word "problem".
- **Product nav/chrome** uses the memo §1 nouns: Finding · Frontier · Evidence ·
  Attempt · Submission · Review · Workspace · Run · Registry · Atlas. "problems"
  is retired from product chrome (the catalogue is **Frontiers**).

### "claim" vs "finding": the resolved rule

These are **not** synonyms, and the apparent doubling was web-only drift (now
fixed: the product surfaces say *finding* for the record and *assertion* for the
proposition it carries).

- **Finding** = the *record*: the deposited `FindingBundle` (`vf_`) with its
  assertion, evidence, provenance, confidence, and links. This is the product
  noun, used everywhere a person reads about the unit.
- **claim** is retained ONLY where it is not a finding-synonym:
  1. the **formal claim-context cell** `z = (q, c)` and the **Claim-State Cell**
     projection (`frontier_calculus`, `vela state`): a proposition under
     a scope, a defined object distinct from a bundle;
  2. the **verb "to claim"**: `vela work <obligation> --as agent:<id>` leases an
     open obligation. You claim a lease on work; you do not create a finding.
  3. `verifier_attachment::claim_digest`, the sha256 of an assertion string,
     byte-matched to Python's `canopus_trust.py::claim_digest`. Renaming it
     would break cross-implementation content-addressing.

`vela finding` mutates finding proposals, `vela work` leases an obligation, and
`vela state` reads the claim-state projection.

See `frontier_graph::FindingState` for Plane 2 and `frontier_calculus` for
Plane 3.

## The canonical event log

A guided tour of `.vela/events/`. By the end of this section you will be
able to open a frontier cold, read its event log, and verify its integrity
against the materialized state.

The authoritative spec is this document. The kernel spec is
`docs/CARINA.md`. This section is the concrete walkthrough that
neither of those is.

### 1. What the event log is

Every reviewer action that changes frontier state lands as exactly one
canonical event in `.vela/events/<vev_id>.json`. The directory is the
substrate's source of truth. The materialized `frontier.json` and the
sidecar files under `.vela/findings/`, `.vela/proposals/`, etc. are
projections. A fresh replay of the event log over an empty `Project`
re-derives them byte-for-byte.

This inversion is the core of the substrate's doctrine. Most research
tooling treats the materialized artifact as primary and the audit log
as a debugging aid. Vela treats the event log as primary and the
artifact as a cache. Two consequences:

- A reviewer cannot mutate state silently. There is no path to
  `frontier.json` that does not go through a signed canonical event.
- Anyone with the substrate binary and the `.vela/events/` directory
  can reconstruct the same frontier and detect tampering. The audit
  trail is the protocol, not a wrapper around it.

The reducer is at `crates/vela-protocol/src/reducer.rs`. Its top
comment puts it precisely:

> `apply_event` is the deterministic state-transition function:
> given a `Project` and a `StateEvent`, it produces the next
> `Project`. It does not construct events, validate proposals, or
> call into network code.

The canonical event kinds are declared in
`crates/vela-protocol/src/events.rs`. There are roughly three dozen
of them. Lifecycle kinds for findings, negative results, trajectories,
artifacts, replications, predictions, bridges, plus governance kinds
(`tier.set`, `key.revoke`) and federation kinds
(`frontier.synced_with_peer`, `frontier.conflict_detected`,
`frontier.conflict_resolved`).

Two replayability invariants the reducer enforces:

- The dispatch table in `apply_event` and the
  `REDUCER_MUTATION_KINDS` constant must agree. CI fails if they do
  not.
- Every reducer arm is idempotent under identical re-application.
  Running the same event twice produces the same state as running it
  once. v0.66 hardened this for span repairs; v0.71 hardened it for
  frontier materialization.

### 2. The shape of an event

Here is an illustrative `finding.reviewed` event, in full. Each event is
stored as `<frontier>/.vela/events/<vev_id>.json`:

```json
{
  "schema": "vela.event.v0.1",
  "id": "vev_85621cac7ca02583",
  "kind": "finding.reviewed",
  "target": {
    "type": "finding",
    "id": "vf_8b47d4846c86bc8f"
  },
  "actor": {
    "id": "agent:vela-curation-bot-2026-05-09",
    "type": "human"
  },
  "timestamp": "2026-05-08T23:26:34.327816+00:00",
  "reason": "Evidence span verbatim backs the assertion: the witness is a 505-point Sidon set in {0,1}^16 (all pairwise sums distinct) and the cited source states the improved bound a(16) >= 505. Frozen-verifier receipt attached.",
  "before_hash": "sha256:c30bc9bf0237a6dc23311d1f48fa024ec65e46547b69130b68fec296795d9f5d",
  "after_hash": "sha256:11244dc98f9be54fdc0b4e0b45c5162e6493d21687266433774bed8835d25a85",
  "payload": {
    "proposal_id": "vpr_1239df3e9393e02c",
    "status": "accepted"
  },
  "caveats": []
}
```

Field by field:

- `schema` is `vela.event.v0.1`. The constant lives at
  `events.rs:18`. Bumping the schema is a protocol change; the v0.1
  shape has been stable since v0.3 when the reducer was extracted.
- `id` is content-addressed. The id is
  `vev_<first 16 hex chars of sha256(canonical bytes)>`, where the
  canonical bytes are the JSON object containing every other field
  in this list. The function is `compute_event_id` at
  `events.rs:1350`. Two events with byte-identical content produce
  the same id; the directory cannot hold a duplicate.
- `kind` is one of the canonical event kinds declared in
  `events.rs`. The reducer dispatches on this string. Unknown kinds
  are an error; the substrate refuses to load an event log
  containing a kind it does not recognize.
- `target` names the object the event acts on. `type` is the kernel
  object class (`finding`, `negative_result`, `trajectory`,
  `artifact`, `bridge`, etc.). `id` is the object's stable id. The
  reducer uses `target.id` to locate the object inside `Project`.
- `actor` is who emitted the event. The `id` follows the
  `agent:<actor-key>` or `human:<handle>` convention; `type` is
  `human` or `agent`. v0.49 added `key.revoke` so a compromised
  actor key can be retired without invalidating prior history. The
  full actor list lives at `.vela/actors.json`.
- `timestamp` is RFC 3339 with microsecond precision and an explicit
  timezone offset. The reducer does not require monotonic time, but
  the integrity check warns on out-of-order timestamps within a
  single object's chain.
- `reason` is free text. It is the reviewer's argument for why the
  event should land. Empty reasons fail validation on
  `finding.reviewed`. The reason is part of the canonical bytes, so
  it is hashed into the event id and signed alongside everything
  else.
- `before_hash` and `after_hash` are sha256 commitments to the
  target object's serialized state immediately before and after the
  reducer applies this event. `before_hash` is `sha256:null` for
  genesis events (the first event on a fresh target). The chain is
  the integrity invariant: replaying the log must reproduce each
  `after_hash`.
- `payload` is kind-specific. For `finding.reviewed` it carries the
  proposal id and the verdict (`accepted`, `needs_revision`,
  `rejected`). For `finding.span_repaired` it carries the section
  and the repaired span text inline so replay does not need to
  re-resolve a sidecar.
- `caveats` is the list of reviewer-attached qualifications.
  `finding.asserted` events emitted from manual entry carry the
  caveat `"Manual findings require evidence review before scientific
  use."` automatically.
- `signature` (not present on this event) is the optional Ed25519
  signature over the canonical bytes minus the signature field
  itself. Signatures are stored at the frontier root in
  `.vela/signatures.json`, keyed by event id. A working-draft frontier
  may be unsigned; the Sidon and Erdős frontiers are signed end-to-end.

### 3. Walking a real reviewer flow

Trace an illustrative finding `vf_8f2d8f546976dcb3` (a Sidon lower-bound
finding) through its full chain. Four events, in canonical order.

#### Event 1: `finding.asserted` (genesis)

`<frontier>/.vela/events/vev_b4908222150d4693.json`:

```json
{
  "schema": "vela.event.v0.1",
  "id": "vev_b4908222150d4693",
  "kind": "finding.asserted",
  "target": { "type": "finding", "id": "vf_8f2d8f546976dcb3" },
  "actor": { "id": "agent:vela-curation-bot-2026-05-09", "type": "human" },
  "timestamp": "2026-05-08T21:47:18.101136+00:00",
  "reason": "Manual finding added to frontier state",
  "before_hash": "sha256:null",
  "after_hash": "sha256:07429d20ff95dc946cc1c8598d40b103e9cf13986e3806ddb4c576a6c1e31d30",
  "payload": { "proposal_id": "vpr_0481441a4da6f6b0" },
  "caveats": ["Manual findings require evidence review before scientific use."]
}
```

`before_hash` is `sha256:null`. This is the first event on the
finding. The reducer creates the finding object from the proposal
referenced by `payload.proposal_id`, applies the manual-findings
caveat, and produces the post-state whose serialized form hashes to
`after_hash`.

#### Event 2: `finding.reviewed` (needs_revision)

`vev_8cb9b3daa9db5064.json`, six hours later:

```json
{
  "kind": "finding.reviewed",
  "target": { "type": "finding", "id": "vf_8f2d8f546976dcb3" },
  "timestamp": "2026-05-08T23:33:32.623559+00:00",
  "reason": "Span is the construction paragraph. It does not state the verified bound a(16) >= 505 or the distinct-pairwise-sums property. The construction is sound, but the attached span does not carry the claim. Needs a span from the body that names the bound and the witness size.",
  "before_hash": "sha256:07429d20ff95dc946cc1c8598d40b103e9cf13986e3806ddb4c576a6c1e31d30",
  "after_hash": "sha256:d92a580353cbd02f3f74ea59fdacac6b92d679c0e96832e4358cda26364c78f1",
  "payload": { "proposal_id": "vpr_8093eb8a5018cacb", "status": "needs_revision" }
}
```

Two things to notice. First, `before_hash` is exactly the previous
event's `after_hash`. The chain is welded. Second, the reviewer
rejected the evidence span without retracting the finding. The
`needs_revision` verdict is not a draft state; it is a recorded
disagreement that flows downstream into the
`status="needs_revision"` filter on verified-grade surfaces.

#### Event 3: `finding.span_repaired` (v0.66 mechanical repair)

`vev_3790dc7f05c5f13a.json`, the next day:

```json
{
  "kind": "finding.span_repaired",
  "target": { "type": "finding", "id": "vf_8f2d8f546976dcb3" },
  "timestamp": "2026-05-09T00:41:43.985878+00:00",
  "reason": "W2.1 synonym + stem seed-span repair: the v0.66 picker now resolves the bound phrasings (a(16) vs B2({0,1}^16), 'Sidon set' vs 'B2 set', 'distinct pairwise sums' vs 'distinct sums') and clears the 0.30 floor against the cached source, replacing the prior construction-paragraph span with a result-bearing sentence.",
  "before_hash": "sha256:d92a580353cbd02f3f74ea59fdacac6b92d679c0e96832e4358cda26364c78f1",
  "after_hash": "sha256:9f6ad5875ba2b0910f0e031a9f6d90e93137de63e64b1af06700fbbb5df017c0",
  "payload": {
    "proposal_id": "vpr_78c0a6d122f7883d",
    "section": "abstract",
    "text": "We exhibit a Sidon set of 505 points in {0,1}^16, with all C(506,2) pairwise sums distinct, improving the previous lower bound from a(16) >= 503 to a(16) >= 505."
  }
}
```

The span text is carried inline on `payload.text`. The reducer
appends it to `state.findings[i].evidence.evidence_spans` and is
idempotent: re-applying the same event is a no-op because the span
is already present. The repair carries its full input on the event
so a fresh replay does not need to re-fetch the source PDF.

#### Event 4: `finding.reviewed` (accepted)

`vev_50ecd1186170042f.json`, twenty-eight milliseconds later:

```json
{
  "kind": "finding.reviewed",
  "target": { "type": "finding", "id": "vf_8f2d8f546976dcb3" },
  "timestamp": "2026-05-09T00:41:44.013451+00:00",
  "reason": "Evidence span repaired by the synonym-aware seed-span extractor; the assertion is grounded in the source's result-bearing sentence.",
  "before_hash": "sha256:9f6ad5875ba2b0910f0e031a9f6d90e93137de63e64b1af06700fbbb5df017c0",
  "after_hash": "sha256:decf61cc60f424e605662ae3af6c4d5205d9ebdd2c30ccfef41e177434cc2f9e",
  "payload": { "proposal_id": "vpr_c1a01170baa92fab", "status": "accepted" }
}
```

`before_hash` matches the repair's `after_hash`. The chain holds.
The finding is now accepted on the frontier and surfaces on
verified-grade reads.

#### Why content addressing matters

The id `vev_50ecd1186170042f` is a sha256 prefix over the canonical
bytes of every other field, computed by `compute_event_id` in
`events.rs:1350`. This means:

- An event cannot be edited in place. Any change produces a different
  id and breaks the next event's `before_hash` reference.
- Two implementations that emit the same logical event produce
  byte-identical files. The cross-impl reducer fixtures at
  `crates/vela-protocol/tests/cross_impl_reducer_fixtures.rs` rely on
  this.
- Reordering events does not silently corrupt history, because the
  `before_hash` chain pins the order.

### 4. Verifying integrity yourself

Run the substrate's integrity checker on a frontier:

```
$ vela check <frontier> --strict --json
```

Output (illustrative):

```json
{
  "schema": "vela.state_integrity_report.v0.1",
  "status": "fail",
  "structural_errors": [
    { "rule_id": "stale_proof_packet",
      "message": "Recorded proof packet is stale relative to accepted events." }
  ],
  "warnings": [],
  "proof_freshness": "stale",
  "replay": {
    "ok": true,
    "status": "ok",
    "event_log": {
      "count": 29,
      "kinds": {
        "finding.asserted": 9,
        "finding.reviewed": 15,
        "finding.span_repaired": 5
      },
      "first_timestamp": "2026-05-08T20:45:26.713195+00:00",
      "last_timestamp": "2026-05-09T01:24:56.592081+00:00",
      "duplicate_ids": [],
      "orphan_targets": []
    },
    "source_hash": "959ab2a422e6c3b7d292c6ccdd831308a32a48adbe8d59c6c72197366344631c",
    "event_log_hash": "13de6c2230ca2ea3b81760cf71c9afb0a8c8afeacf989c300c5a2cc25b98fa73",
    "replayed_hash": "959ab2a422e6c3b7d292c6ccdd831308a32a48adbe8d59c6c72197366344631c",
    "current_hash": "959ab2a422e6c3b7d292c6ccdd831308a32a48adbe8d59c6c72197366344631c",
    "conflicts": []
  },
  "summary": { "events": 29, "proposals": 29, "structural_errors": 1, "warnings": 0 }
}
```

What each part checks:

- `replay.event_log.count` and `replay.event_log.kinds` are a tally
  of `.vela/events/`. The `duplicate_ids` and `orphan_targets`
  arrays are empty when every event id is unique and every
  `target.id` resolves to a known object.
- `replay.source_hash` is the hash of the materialized
  `frontier.json` after canonicalization. `replay.replayed_hash` is
  the hash of the `Project` produced by replaying the log from
  genesis. They must agree. If they diverge, the substrate refuses
  the frontier.
- `replay.current_hash` is what the loaded in-memory state hashes
  to. The three-way agreement (source, replayed, current) is the
  invariant that no silent edit has slipped past the reducer.
- `replay.event_log_hash` is the hash of the canonical event log
  itself. It is what the proof packet pins; federation peers compare
  this digest before diffing.
- `proof_freshness` is one of `fresh`, `stale`, `missing`. The
  frontier shown is `stale` because a `finding.reviewed` event
  landed after the most recent proof packet was generated. The
  `stale_reason` in `.vela/proof-state.json` names the offending
  proposal. Running `vela proof export` on the frontier returns it
  to `fresh`.

This frontier reports `status: fail` for exactly that
reason. A fresh frontier passes; a frontier with a stale proof
packet fails until the packet is regenerated. Replay itself is
green: `replay.ok: true` confirms the materialized state matches
the event log byte-for-byte.

The same three digests (`source_hash`, `event_log_hash`,
`packet_manifest_hash`) are rendered on each frontier's page on the
public site, read from the published proof manifest at build time.
They match the digests this command prints, by construction.

### 5. Federation: same event log, two hubs

When a peer hub serves a copy of an event log, a consumer diffs the
peer's event ids against the local `.vela/events/` directory. Under
the git-native model this is ordinary git: two hubs indexing the same
frontier repo agree by construction, and `vela hub witness-check`
asserts byte-identical agreement across hubs.

The event vocabulary for recording a divergence survives from the
retired `vela federation` CLI plane: `frontier.synced_with_peer`
records a comparison, `frontier.conflict_detected` names the local
event id, the peer's event id, and the field that diverges, and a
reviewer resolves a conflict by emitting `frontier.conflict_resolved`
(v0.59), which links back to the original `conflict_detected` event
id and records the verdict. These are canonical events like any
other; historical logs containing them replay unchanged.

The doctrine is symmetric: the diff itself is part of the event log,
not metadata about it. A reviewer cannot resolve a federation
conflict silently, the same way they cannot edit a finding silently.

### 6. Doctrine recap

- No silent edits. Every reviewer action is one canonical event in
  `.vela/events/`. The materialized `frontier.json` is a projection
  the reducer re-derives.
- The audit trail is the protocol. Event ids are content-addressed
  sha256 prefixes; `before_hash` and `after_hash` weld the chain;
  signatures cover the canonical bytes.
- Drafts and `needs_revision` findings are excluded from
  verified-grade surfaces by filter, not by deletion. The events
  remain in the log.
- Reproducible from any working tree. `vela check <frontier> --strict`
  replays from genesis, hashes the result, and compares against the
  materialized state. Two implementations that share the protocol
  produce byte-identical replays.

The substrate's promise is that any reader, with the binary and the
`.vela/` directory, can rederive the frontier and decide for
themselves whether the chain holds. The walk above is what doing
that looks like.

## Conformance

The Vela protocol is only open if an independent implementation can
prove it agrees with the reference. This section is how a third party
does that. (The normative requirement list for a conforming v0
implementation is §10.)

### What is public

- `conformance/`: the public conformance contract: fixtures, a
  human-readable `README.md` describing the
  `(genesis_findings, event_log, expected_states)` replay contract,
  and `verify.py`, a thin reference runner over the canonical Python
  reducer.
- `tests/conformance/`: the protocol vector set the reference Rust
  implementation runs via `vela check --conformance`.

Both directories are tracked in the repository. Nothing about running
them depends on private state.

### Running the suite

Against this repository's implementations:

```bash
./scripts/run-conformance-suite.sh --out dist/conformance
```

This runs the reference Rust implementation (`vela check --conformance`) and
the reference Python reducer (`conformance/verify.py`), then writes a
content-addressed `conformance-report.json`
(schema `vela.conformance_report.v0.1`): per-implementation
total/passed/failed, the implementation id, the SHA-256 of the vector
set, and a report digest over the substantive body. Two runs over the
same vectors produce the same `report_sha256`; a divergent
implementation produces a different report.

An independent implementation runs the same vectors against its own
reducer (mirroring `conformance/verify.py`'s contract) and emits a
report in the same shape. Comparing the two reports' per-kind results
and `vector_set_sha256` is the conformance check.

### What a conformant report asserts

That the implementation agrees with the reference reducer on per-kind
state-transition mutation across the public vector set: finding,
negative-result, trajectory, and artifact effects after replaying the
event log.

### What it does not assert

It does not assert that any frontier's science is correct, that the
substrate is feature-complete, that proof packets are validated, or
that the implementation is safe for production. It is a replay-contract
agreement check and nothing more. Scientific truth stays a reviewer
judgment; conformance is only about deterministic replay.

### Boundary

Conformance is a property of an implementation against the public
vectors. It does not certify an implementation, confer membership in
any organization, or imply a governing entity exists. The institutional
structure that would steward the spec is described, as a proposal, in
`docs/GOVERNANCE.md`.

## Appendix: Signed checkpoints (deferred)

*Folded from the former CHECKPOINTS.md.*

Status: **specified, not implemented.** Implementation is deliberately
deferred until a frontier's event log exceeds ~50,000 events; the largest
live log today is ~1,300 events and replays in well under a second. This
document exists so the format is decided *before* the first log that
needs it, not during the incident that demands it.

## Problem

Replay cost grows linearly with the log (`replay_from_genesis` is O(N)
since v0.105), and the log is stored as one JSON file per event. At
hundreds of events this is invisible; at hundreds of thousands it means
slow loads, slow `vela check`, and a heavy clone for every new consumer.
Git solved the same problem with packfiles; Vela's analogue is the
checkpoint: a **signed, replayable waypoint** in the event log.

## The record

```json
{
  "schema": "vela.checkpoint.v0.1",
  "checkpoint_id": "vcp_<sha256(canonical_body_with_id_empty)[:16]>",
  "vfr_id": "vfr_…",
  "event_log_hash": "<events::event_log_hash of events[0..=n]>",
  "snapshot_hash": "<events::snapshot_hash of the replayed state at n>",
  "event_count": 50000,
  "last_event_id": "vev_…",
  "prev_checkpoint": "vcp_… | null",
  "created_at": "RFC3339",
  "signature": "<Ed25519 over canonical bytes, signature field empty>",
  "signer_pubkey_hex": "<the frontier owner's registered key>"
}
```

Every field is already computable with existing kernel functions:
`events::event_log_hash`, `events::snapshot_hash`, and the canonical-JSON
content-address rule used by every other `v*_` id. The `vela.lock`
fields (`snapshot_hash`, `event_log_hash`) are precisely a checkpoint
without the signature or the chain: the lock is the degenerate latest
checkpoint, which is why this design adds no new hash semantics.

## Semantics

- **Replay-from-checkpoint.** A consumer that trusts checkpoint `vcp_X`
  loads the materialized state whose `snapshot_hash` matches, then
  replays only `events[n..]`. Trust is explicit: you trust the OWNER KEY
  that signed the checkpoint, exactly as you trust a registry manifest.
  Full replay from genesis remains available to anyone, always: a
  checkpoint accelerates verification, it never replaces it.
- **The chain.** `prev_checkpoint` forms a hash-linked chain back to
  genesis. Verifying a checkpoint chain = verifying each link's
  signature + recomputing the two hashes at each waypoint. Cost is
  O(N) once, then O(delta) forever after.
- **Log segments.** With checkpoints in place, events between two
  checkpoints can be packed into one append-only JSONL segment file
  (`events/segment-<vcp_id>.jsonl`), replacing thousands of per-event
  files. Per-event files remain the write format for the active tail;
  packing is a maintenance operation (`vela frontier pack`, future),
  byte-stable and reversible since events are content-addressed.
- **Earliest-wins discipline.** Checkpoints are append-only; a
  checkpoint is never edited or replaced. A bad checkpoint is abandoned
  (the chain forks past it), never rewritten: same rule as every other
  signed record in the protocol.

## Non-goals

- No checkpoint authority other than the frontier owner key (a second
  producer signs their OWN checkpoints over the same log).
- No compression/dedup cleverness in v0.1: JSONL segments are plain.
- No change to event ids, event signing, or the reducer. A checkpoint
  is derived state; the log remains the only source of truth.

## Trigger to implement

Any frontier crossing 50k events, or measured `vela check` replay time
crossing ~5s on the reference machine, whichever comes first.
