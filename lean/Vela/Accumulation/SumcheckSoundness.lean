# Single-variable root bound used by a historical sum-check experiment

The historical `scripts/pck_spartan.py` demo rejects one forged folded
instance. This file proves a single-variable Schwartz-Zippel root bound used by
that experiment.

In each sum-check round the honest prover would send a specific degree-`≤ d` univariate polynomial `p`;
a cheating prover sends some `g ≠ p` (forced to differ because the claimed sum is wrong). The verifier
picks a uniformly random challenge `r` and continues with the cheater only if `g(r) = p(r)`. Since
`g - p` is a nonzero polynomial of degree `≤ d`, it has at most `d` roots, so there are at most `d`
"fooling" challenges out of `|F|` for the declared one-round model.

`sumcheck_round_sound` states exactly this: the set of fooling challenges has cardinality `≤ d`.

It does not formalize a full sum-check transcript, round composition,
challenge generation, Fiat-Shamir, completeness, or total protocol soundness,
and it remains outside the active theorem aggregate.

/-- **Sum-check round soundness (single-variable Schwartz–Zippel).** Over a finite field `F`, if a
    cheating round polynomial `g` differs from the honest one `p` (both of degree `≤ d`), then the set
    of challenges `r` at which the verifier fails to notice (`g(r) = p(r)`) has cardinality at most `d`.
    Hence a cheat survives a round with probability `≤ d / |F|`. -/
