//! The one signing rule.
//!
//! Every signature in Vela is taken over the bytes returned by
//! [`signing_input`]. Before this, each object hand-assembled its own canonical
//! preimage and signed it directly, so a second producer had to reimplement
//! each builder to verify. Now the per-object builders produce a canonical body
//! and frame it through this single function, so the signing rule is one place.
//!
//! Two versions, and the version is the migration seam (`docs/TRUST_MODEL_REDESIGN.md`
//! sections 3 and 12):
//!
//! - **v0** is the historical form: the raw canonical body, byte-identical to
//!   the pre-facade builders. Every existing signature verifies under it.
//! - **v1** frames the body with DSSE Pre-Authentication Encoding (PAE), which
//!   binds both a typed media string and the body length under the signature.
//!
//! v1 is wired but not yet the default: the flip to v1 for new signatures, and
//! the re-sign that retires v0, are later phases. PAE does NOT remove canonical
//! JSON: the body is still the RFC-8785 canonicalization used to mint ids and
//! log hashes. The win is one typed byte-framing rule a producer can implement
//! by concatenation.

/// signature so historical v0 signatures keep verifying after v1 lands.
