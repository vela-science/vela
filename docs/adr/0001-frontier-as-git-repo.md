# ADR 0001: A frontier should be a git repo, not a parallel git

- Status: Accepted 2026-06-24. Phase 0 landed (agent-doable); Phase 1+ pending
  Will key-custody. Target sharpened 2026-06-25 to **repo-native Vela** (below).
- 2026-07-14: **The prelaunch transport cutover is complete.** The bespoke
  publish/clone/pull/workspace path, Hub state-write path, S3 object mirror,
  snapshot/manifest backfills, and blob redirects are removed. `merkle.rs`
  remains as the offline-verifiable transparency primitive. Publication is `git push`:
  the hub runs a git-ingestion loop (validate + strict reducer replay +
  signature signals) over root repositories selected in a versioned operator
  source catalog. There is no source-registration endpoint, monorepo-subdir
  replay, or parallel signed publication record. A `no-legacy-transport` grep
  gate holds the line. The restore drill proves credible exit through the real lane.
  Phase 1 (the re-sign ceremony) remains Will's: erdos-problems and
  benchmark-state still refuse strict ingest on `unsigned_registered_actor`
  (pre-signing events from a now-registered actor).
- 2026-06-25 progress (no re-sign needed): the lock self-describes + enforces its
  verifier contract (`verifiers:` pin), and the producing repo now hydrates its
  frontiers from GIT (`vela-frontiers`), not the hub — the hub is demoted to a
  fallback/index. A plain `git clone` of vela-frontiers reproduces every witness
  with the hub offline; the gate git-hydrates all six and stays 0 FAIL. This is
  the source-of-truth half of the cutover, achieved without the path migration or
  the re-sign ceremony.
- Deciders: Will (key custody), substrate
- Question that triggered it: "Why are we rebuilding git ourselves instead of
  referencing a GitHub repo?"

## Target (2026-06-25): repo-native Vela

> Vela's long-term target is repo-native scientific state: Git-compatible,
> cloneable, forkable frontiers whose canonical truth is the accepted Vela event
> history, not the hub database. Git provides commodity transport and
> collaboration; Vela provides the scientific state machine. **Git is the
> substrate. Vela is the protocol.**

This is NOT "frontier = a normal git repo" (git does not know what a claim, a
receipt, a reducer, or a valid frontier transition is) and NOT "hub is authority"
(a centralized hub with a custom transport is the wrong shape for a science
protocol that needs portability, mirrors, institutional custody, and offline
audit). Git owns transport, fork, branch, diff, PR, blob references, and human
inspection; Vela owns what counts as a valid event, accepted vs proposed state,
replay, reducers, receipts, verifier meaning, trust policy, review gates,
materialization, semantic diff, provenance, retractions, and public/private
overlays. The frontier must survive without the hub.

One correction to the "delete list" below survives implementation:

- **`merkle.rs` STAYS.** It is a self-contained RFC-6962 transparency log,
  validated against the published CT test vectors. Replacing it with
  sigstore/rekor would add a hosted network dependency that breaks "survives
  without the hub." A self-contained, offline-verifiable CT log is aligned with
  the target, not a wheel to discard.

The genuine reinvention to retire is the **transport** (`cli_registry`
clone/pull/push, `registry.rs` remote, `workspace.rs`, `hydrate-frontiers.sh`,
the `db.rs` write-path-as-authority). That is retired by the git-native cutover
(Phase 1+2), not a library swap. The near-term, re-sign-free Phase A win is
making the frontier **self-describing** (`.vela/{schemas,reducers,policies,
receipts,attestations}/` + a `materialization-manifest.json` that pins the
schema/reducer/policy/verifier-rule versions) so it replays from a clean git
checkout with no hub and no assumption about which binary you have.

## Execution status (2026-06-24)

Phase 0 is implemented, gate-green (34/37 PASS, 0 FAIL), and committed. One
finding improves on the body below:

- **0a is ZERO re-sign**, contradicting the "re-sign every lock" assumption in
  the migration table. The events are stored as `vev_<id>.json`, so the
  directory loader already sorts by id, and that id-order is exactly what the
  current locks encode. So `event_log_hash` now canonicalizes on **id** (not the
  causal `(timestamp, id)` replay order the table assumed). That gives the same
  load-path independence the migration needs while leaving every existing lock
  byte-identical, verified across all six frontiers. The re-sign ceremony 0a was
  expected to force is not needed.
- **0b** ships as a `materialize-determinism` gate step (double-materialize,
  assert identical `snapshot_hash` + `event_log_hash`).
- **0d** ships the cryptographic parent-binding: the accept decision preimage now
  binds the head being accepted against, and the verifier recomputes it from its
  own pre-accept project, so a captured accept replayed onto a re-ordered or
  extended history is rejected (test `authorize_accept_against_stale_head_rejected`).
  The boundary binding is complete for the current hub-authoritative model. The
  one piece genuinely coupled to Phase 1 is recording the decision signature +
  parent INTO the accept event so a GitHub Action can re-verify it without a
  hub. That is a change to the accept event structure with no consumer until the
  hub stops being the append authority, so it lands with the cutover, not before.
- **0e** ships as the root `action.yml` composite action: install a pinned
  binary, then reproduce + check --strict + hash-parity. Frontier repositories
  reference the versioned public action directly and mark that PR check
  required; the substrate carries no second local copy.

Still pending and genuinely yours (key custody): 0c (publish the frontiers + gate
scripts to a public repo so there is something to fork), the Phase 1 re-sign +
git-backed cutover, and the accept-event self-verification recording above.

## The short answer

The instinct is right. Roughly 4,500 to 5,200 lines of the substrate are git,
GitHub, and git-LFS reimplemented by hand. The thesis is "Git + HuggingFace +
Codex for science," so a hand-rolled parallel git is off-thesis weight, not
moat. We should keep the part that is genuinely ours and let git carry the rest.

But there is one fact that turns "swap the transport" into "change a signed
hash," and it decides the whole sequencing. It is in the next section. Read it
before the plan.

## The decisive fact: git-backed is a hash-definition change, not a transport swap

`event_log_hash` is computed over the events vector **in load order**
(`events.rs:927`). The loaders do not agree on that order:

- the packet path reads an authored array (`repo.rs:213`);
- the `.vela/events/` directory path does `read_dir` then sorts by filename,
  i.e. `vev_id` order (`repo.rs:398-405`);
- replay wants `(timestamp, id)` order (`reducer.rs:343`);
- incremental append prefix-hashes the stored order (`cli_registry.rs:615`).

If a frontier becomes a git repo with one committed file per event, the on-disk
order becomes `vev_id` filename order. That silently re-defines
`event_log_hash`, so **every existing signed lock fails byte-parity until it is
re-signed**. Re-signing accepted, frozen registry entries is a human
key-custody act that an agent may not perform (VELA.md). So the storage move is
gated on a Will ceremony, and that ceremony is gated on first making
`event_log_hash` order-canonical so the re-sign only has to happen once.

A second instance of the same class: `snapshot_hash` (`events.rs:932`) is
computed over the materialized `frontier.json`, which is gitignored as derived.
The signed lock therefore pins a hash of an artifact that is never committed and
is regenerated by `vela frontier materialize`. If materialize is ever
non-deterministic across toolchain or Mathlib pins or float formatting or map
iteration order, CI recomputes a different `snapshot_hash` and the frontier
becomes unmergeable with no event-level cause. Clone-time parity catches this
once today; moving it into CI makes it a recurring merge-blocker unless
materialize determinism is pinned first.

Conclusion: the migration is real and worth doing, but it is sequenced behind
two correctness fixes, not a weekend transport swap.

## What is git, reimplemented (the delete list)

Measured against the live code. These go to git, GitHub, and git-LFS.

| Surface | File | LOC | Replaced by |
|---|---|---|---|
| clone/pull/push/status/registry verbs | `vela-cli/src/cli_registry.rs` | 1,882 | `git clone/pull/push/status` + a ~150-LOC materialize+parity shim |
| publish/append/pull plumbing, signed ref | `vela-protocol/src/registry.rs` | 1,825 | git remote + LFS + signed tags; `pull_transitive` becomes a pinned submodule |
| ~~RFC-6962 Merkle tree~~ **KEEP** | `vela-protocol/src/merkle.rs` | 492 | self-contained offline CT log; rekor/sigstore would add a hosted dependency that breaks "survives without the hub" |
| blob tier (Tigris, sha256 key) | `vela-hub/src/storage.rs` | 191 | deleted; Git/LFS or repository-owned artifact locators carry bytes |
| workspace registry | `vela-protocol/src/workspace.rs` | 144 | git remotes + submodule config |
| append/promote write path | `vela-hub/src/db.rs` (write path) | ~1,000 | GitHub receive-pack + branch protection + the Action |
| hydrate (= `git checkout`) | `scripts/hydrate-frontiers.sh` | 80 | `git clone` + `git lfs pull` + `vela frontier materialize` |

The `before_hash`/`after_hash` chain on every event (`events.rs:398`, validated
`events.rs:1019-1036`) is a parent-linked, content-addressed, append-only Merkle
commit chain. That is git's object model, rebuilt. It is the clearest single
piece of evidence that the transport layer is reinvention.

## What is genuinely ours (the keep list)

git gives content-addressing and a Merkle DAG for free. It gives none of this,
and none of it moves during a transport swap:

| Component | Why git cannot do it |
|---|---|
| typed reducer (`reducer.rs`, `sorted_for_replay` at 343) + materialize | a git commit is an opaque snapshot; a Vela event is a typed transition a reducer interprets into derived state |
| frozen verifiers (`vela-verify`, ~4,152 LOC) | git checks bytes did not change; the verifier re-derives that a Sidon set is a Sidon set, a Lean proof is kernel-clean |
| canonical-JSON ids (`canonical.rs`, RFC-8785) | git hashes raw bytes including whitespace; Vela identity is over canonicalized typed objects |
| accept gate (`proposals.rs:522` authorize, `:463` preimage) | a five-condition, human-key-signed predicate an AI cannot pass; a branch merge is not an accept |
| signed event chain + `replay_report` (`events.rs`) | hashes the materialized claim transition, not a file blob |

The rule that falls out: **git stores and transports; the verifiers judge; a
human key accepts.** Keep the judgment and the accept. Stop hand-rolling the
store and the transport.

## The hub: index, not store

The hub is two things wearing one name. The store half is reinvention and goes
to git. The index half is genuine and stays.

- Delete (store): the blob tier (`storage.rs`), snapshot/event/manifest
  byte-serving (`main.rs:630,3332`). A git remote and LFS serve these bytes.
- Keep (index): cross-frontier search (`/search`, `db.rs:385`), the producer CV
  cross-key join (`/producers/:pubkey`, `db.rs:892`), reverse-dependency
  (`/entries/:vfr/depends-on`), rollup summaries (`/summary`), read-only event
  streams, and the operator's versioned source catalog. `merkle.rs` stays as an
  offline protocol primitive, not a Hub signing service. None of these index
  operations owns frontier bytes or scientific authority.

The hub stops being a second object store and becomes a read and query index
over the git repos. That is the version of the hub worth running.

## Options considered

> Implementation note (2026-07-14): the detached acceptance preimage explored
> below was removed before external launch. ADR 0003's Decision Plan now binds
> the reviewed facts and resulting signed `review.*` events directly.

Three were designed and then adversarially critiqued. Each critique found a real
flaw; none survives unmodified, which is why the decision is a sequence.

1. **Full git-backed** (effort XL). The on-thesis end state. Doctrinally sound:
   accept stays a committed, human-signed event, so merge alone is never accept.
   Fatal-if-rushed: it inherits the `event_log_hash` ordering change above, and
   an early detached-accept prototype covered the decision fields but **not**
   the parent chain hash, so a valid signature was replayable onto a re-ordered
   or forked history. Linear history blocks force-push, not replay. That
   prototype was removed before launch; the Decision Plan now binds the exact
   input and event-log roots into the signed event set.

2. **GitHub-Action gate first** (effort L). Byte-parity-safe, signs nothing in
   CI, keeps the human-key accept. But the version we sketched assumed a repo
   topology that does not exist: the frontiers a producer is told to fork
   lived only in the **private** `vela-internal` integration repo, while the
   public substrate carried verifier examples rather than a forkable frontier;
   all five load-bearing gate
   scripts (`full-conformance`, `clone-roundtrip`, `vela-coverage`,
   `review-parity`, `hydrate`) are private. There is nothing public to fork and
   no public gate to run. This option is viable only after the frontiers and the
   gate scripts are published to a public repo. That publish is itself a
   prerequisite, not a footnote.

3. **Reference-repos only** (effort M). On-thesis and cryptographically sound:
   `content_hash` is already inside `snapshot_hash` (`events.rs:932`), so an
   accept signature already commits to upstream bytes. But "nothing in the core
   moves" is false: the blob provider is keyed by hash with no locator in scope
   (`repo.rs:801`), so routing to a `git+` resolver is a public API change; and
   it regresses reproducibility, because a pinned `github.com/x/y@<commit>` is
   only as durable as the upstream repo (deletion, going private, or an outage
   makes a frontier the hub "owns" non-reproducible). Useful as a complement,
   not as the answer.

## Decision

Sequence: **gate-first, then git-backed.** Prove the model where producers
already live before deleting any plumbing, and do not move a signed hash until it
is order-canonical and re-signed.

The agent-doable correctness work (Phase 0) lands first and is valuable on its
own. The storage cutover (Phase 1+) is a Will key-custody ceremony and waits
behind a green Phase 0.

## Migration

| Phase | Does | Gate (must be green to proceed) |
|---|---|---|
| 0a. Order-canonical `event_log_hash` | Hash `sorted_for_replay` order everywhere (`repo.rs` loaders, `cli_registry.rs:615`, `db.rs:1346`); re-pin the conformance vector | `event_log_hash(packet) == event_log_hash(dir)`; full-conformance green. If a current lock now fails parity, STOP and report the re-sign blast radius before going further. |
| 0b. Determinism gate on materialize | Run materialize twice across a pinned toolchain matrix; assert identical `snapshot_hash` | determinism gate green for all six frontiers |
| 0c. Publish the public surface | Move the six frontiers and the five gate scripts into a public repo (today they are private; the on-ramp has nothing to fork without this) | an outsider can `git clone` a frontier + run the public gate |
| 0d. Bind decisions to history | Superseded before launch by the Decision Plan's exact event-log and fact-root binding | changed history invalidates the confirmed plan before the key is read |
| 0e. Vela-binary-as-required-Action (shadow) | Mirror frontiers read-only to GitHub; PR Action runs `vela reproduce`, recomputes hashes, and verifies the signed `review.*` event set through normal replay | a dry-run PR carrying a witness and signed review events goes green without introducing a second accept protocol. **This is the conversion event for goal #66, with no store migration.** |
| 1. Re-sign + git-backed cutover (Will) | Will re-signs all six locks under the order-canonical hash; un-gitignore `.vela/events/`; witnesses to LFS; `frontier.json`/`vela.lock` stay derived; `clone` becomes `git clone` + `lfs pull` + materialize | each frontier clones from GitHub, reproduces, re-derives hashes equal to the re-signed locks; Track-A conflict count not increased vs baseline |
| 2. Retire the bespoke transport | Delete the `cli_registry` git-verbs, `registry.rs` remote, the Hub state-write and object-store paths, `hydrate-frontiers.sh`, and `workspace.rs`; keep `merkle.rs` as the offline transparency primitive | focused conformance is sourced entirely from Git; a cold clone reproduces; a grep gate proves no caller of the deleted transport remains |

## Risks and what we lose

- **Hash-semantics change masquerading as a transport swap** (highest). Mitigated
  by gating git-backed behind Phase 0a + the re-sign.
- **The re-sign is key-custody, blocked on Will.** The cutover is not agent-only,
  by design.
- **Collision with the unresolved Track-A replay conflict.** Six erdos findings
  already fail on microsecond `after_hash` skew; re-derivation may surface or
  multiply them. The Phase 1 gate must refuse a conflict-count regression.
- **The trust root moves onto GitHub-controlled compute.** An admin can disable
  branch protection; an outage blocks accepts; the pinned Action binary is the
  trusted re-deriver. Mitigation, and it is non-negotiable: `vela reproduce`
  stays runnable locally with zero GitHub dependency.
- **Authoritative ordering and revocation timing become git timestamps** the
  Action must re-adjudicate. Keep the revocation-ordering check in the binary.
- **Large-artifact availability.** A Git LFS quota or GC failure can still
  block reproduction for non-scientific reasons. Vela records the content
  digest separately from the retrieval locator so mirrors can be added without
  adding another Hub-owned byte store.
- **Producer ergonomics could regress** (fork, clone, lfs install, branch,
  author canonical JSON, commit, push, PR) versus a flagless `vela land`.
  Ship a `vela land --github` one-command shim.
- The intended loss: ~3,500 to 4,500 lines of hand-rolled git transport (the
  `cli_registry` verbs, `registry.rs` remote, `workspace.rs`, the Hub write and
  object-store paths, and `hydrate`). `merkle.rs` stays. That deletion is the
  point.

## Open questions for Will

1. Do any of the six current signed locks survive Phase 0a unchanged, or do all
   six need re-signing? Phase 0a's gate measures this and sizes the ceremony.
2. Should the accept preimage bind the parent chain hash or the full
   `snapshot_hash`? Binding the chain head closes cross-history replay but
   invalidates accepts on benign concurrent appends. A concurrency-versus-replay
   tradeoff that is yours to call.
3. Resolved before launch: the Hub does not own witness bytes. Git/LFS and
   repository-declared locators carry artifacts; the Vela digest remains the
   stable identity across mirrors.
4. Resolved before launch: attempts do not feed admission through a direct
   deposit writer. Scientific results and negative or partial work cross the
   shared boundary as Receipt v1; historical `attempt.deposited` events remain
   replay-only.
5. Does the Track-A microsecond skew get fixed, frozen-as-known, or multiplied by
   re-derivation? Must be settled before Phase 1.

## What this does for the mission

Goal #66 (a non-maintainer signs an accepted write) is still zero. Phase 0e
attacks it on the producer's home turf: a GitHub-native producer forks, edits,
opens a PR, and the model gates their first signed write as a status check,
closer to where the producer lives than the bespoke hub, and it lands with no
store migration and no re-signing. Git-backed (Phase 1+) is the on-thesis end
state that makes every future external write a normal PR. It is sequenced after
the conversion so the goal is not held hostage to the key-custody hash ceremony.
