//! CLI command surface — the clap `Commands` enum and its `*Action`
//! subcommand enums, split out of `cli.rs` so the ~5k lines of command
//! definitions live apart from the handler functions and dispatch. Pure
//! data: the handlers and `run_command` dispatch stay in `cli.rs`.
//!
//! ## Flag-naming conventions (one name per concept, no aliases)
//! - **Acting identity** → `--as`, everywhere a command acts under an
//!   identity (accept, review, propose, attach, record, finding verbs…).
//!   The value defaults from the configured identity (`vela id`) or
//!   `$VELA_ACTOR_ID`, so the flag is usually omitted entirely.
//!   `--author` survives ONLY on `finding add`/`supersede` as source
//!   attribution (who authored the claim, not who is acting);
//!   `--verifier-actor` names a mechanical verifier identity (CI, lean
//!   keypairs) that is never a decision-maker.
//! - **Signing key** → `--key`. Defaults from `vela id`.
//! - **Targets** → `--hub` (a registry/peer base URL the client talks to),
//!   `--to` (a publish/append destination), `--from` (a read source). One
//!   meaning each; do not overload.
