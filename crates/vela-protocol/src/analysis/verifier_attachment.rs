//! Verifier attachments (`vva_`) and the derived verification gate.
//!
//! ## The hole this closes
//!
//! Everywhere else the substrate is careful: a finding is content
//! addressed, an event is signed, a proof verification carries a
//! verifier's signature ([`crate::proof_verification`]). But the step
//! from "the log says this finding is accepted" to "the *claim* is
//! actually true" was never gated. A reviewer's `finding.reviewed →
//! accepted` event records a *human verdict*; it says nothing about
//! whether an independent verifier ever re-derived the result. The
//! Erdős dogfooding made the cost concrete: 47 of 76 records marked
//! "verified" carried an empty verification field, and the promote
//! path trusted every one.
//!
//! ## The fix: a noun, then a derived gate
//!
//! A [`VerifierAttachment`] is the missing noun — a content-addressed,
//! standalone object (the [`crate::bundle`] `Replication` precedent:
//! first-class, targets a finding by id, never a mutable field on it).
//! It binds *one* verifier's judgment to the *exact* claim it checked,
//! by [`claim_digest`]. [`crate::proof_verification::ProofVerification`]
//! and [`crate::lean_verification`] are two instances of one such
//! method (`lean_kernel`); exact combinatorial recompute is another.
//!
//! The gate, [`derive_gate_status`], is a *function of the
//! attachments*, exactly as [`crate::status_provenance`] derives Belnap
//! status from provenance polynomials and never persists it. There is
//! deliberately **no setter** on [`GateStatus`]: a finding cannot be
//! stamped "verified", it can only *derive* as verified from
//! attachments that satisfy four conditions:
//!
//! - **G1 independence** — ≥2 matched attachments by *different*
//!   `(verifier_method, solver_id)`, with at least one naming another in
//!   `independent_of`. The declaration is one-directional by necessity:
//!   the `vva_` id content-addresses the whole body *including*
//!   `independent_of`, so a mutual 2-cycle (A names B, B names A) is a
//!   hash circularity and cannot be constructed. Independence is a
//!   *declared, auditable* property, not a cryptographic one — a single
//!   producer controls every field; the real diversity signal is
//!   distinct `(method, solver)` here and distinct `implementation_id`
//!   in the exact lane. One self-confirmed run never suffices.
//! - **G2 claim-match** — every passing attachment is bound to the
//!   *current* claim digest and declares `match_to_claim.matches`. A
//!   proof that checks a *different* statement is `passed_but_unmatched`
//!   and counts for nothing.
//! - **G3 adversarial** — at least one adversarial probe present and
//!   *none* refuted. A refuted probe drives the status to `Refuted`.
//! - **G4 well-formed + id-integrity** — attachments are structurally
//!   valid (`vva_` ids, parseable methods) AND their stored id
//!   content-addresses their body (`derive_id() == id`). An attachment
//!   whose id is forged or has drifted from its body is excluded from
//!   the matched set: admission re-derives integrity from frozen
//!   content, it never trusts a self-asserted id.
//!
//! Like Belnap status, the gate is orthogonal to the human review
//! verdict ([`crate::bundle::ReviewState`]) and to Bayesian confidence
//! ([`crate::confidence`]). A finding may be reviewer-`Accepted` and
//! still gate `NeedsVerification` — that gap is the point, and the
//! thing the substrate previously hid.

///      the legacy `Unattested` default the gate otherwise tolerates (the gate

///      unaudited-legacy attack.

///      surviving probe, so a vacuous or misformalized statement with only a
///      `CounterexampleSearch` probe passes it. Auto-admit demands the
///      faithfulness probe explicitly (absent != safe).
///   4. **declared independence**: at least one matched attachment names
///      another matched attachment in `independent_of` (one-directional). This
///      cannot be mutual: the `vva_` id content-addresses the body *including*
///      `independent_of`, so a 2-cycle is a hash circularity (the prior "mutual"
///      rule made this lane unreachable for every honestly-built pair). The
///      declaration is a consistency/audit signal, not cryptographic
///      independence — a single producer controls every field; the real
///      diversity teeth are guards 5 (distinct implementations) and the gate's
///      G1 (distinct method/solver). Do NOT re-tighten this to mutual.
///   5. **not an implementation monoculture**: the matched set carries >=2
///      distinct non-empty `implementation_id`s. N runs of one binary are
///      replication, not independent verification; the gate only *warns*.
///
/// Every matched attachment is also id-integral (G4: `derive_id() == id`),
/// inherited from the gate's `is_base_match`, so a forged-id attachment can
/// never enter the matched set this predicate reasons over.
///
/// Proposal-level guards (synthetic-source signal, live frontier
