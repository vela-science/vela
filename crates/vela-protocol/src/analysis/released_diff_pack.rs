//! v0.213: ReleasedDiffPackRecord — first-class replay state for the
//! v0.201 `diff_pack.released` and v0.205 `diff_pack.reviewed` event
//! arms.
//!
//! Prior cycles left these arms metadata-only (the reducer returned
//! `Ok(())` and nothing on the Project struct changed). That kept the
//! initial implementations small but left a gap: a consumer walking
//! the canonical event log alone cannot answer "what packs have been
//! released on this frontier?" — they had to read sibling
//! `.vela/diff_packs/` directories independently. Three consumers
//! (workbench, site-next, search) each duplicated that walk.
//!
//! v0.213 makes the arms mutate `Project.released_diff_packs` so the
//! event log is self-sufficient for replay. Theorem 29 pins the
//! algebra: replay of N `diff_pack.released` events produces an
//! array of length N with no duplicates by pack_id; subsequent
//! `diff_pack.reviewed` events update verdict + verdict_event_id
//! in place without changing length.
