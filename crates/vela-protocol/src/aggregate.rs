//! v0.35: Consensus aggregation — the inference layer.
//!
//! Given a target finding, the kernel can find other findings making
//! similar claims, weight them by evidence quality (replication
//! count, review state, time decay), and return a consensus
//! confidence with a credible interval.
//!
//! This is what turns Vela from "a database of claims" into "a
//! reasoning surface over claims." Other parts of the substrate
//! describe what's *believed* (findings) and what's *expected*
//! (predictions). This module describes what the *field* collectively
//! holds — derived deterministically from canonical state, never
//! stored.
//!
//! Doctrine: aggregation is a derived view, not a kernel object.
//! Same input frontier → same consensus result, byte-for-byte.
