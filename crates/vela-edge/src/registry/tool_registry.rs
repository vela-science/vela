//! Tool registry — tools defined as data, separate from execution.
//! Borrowed from Codex (MIT) tool-as-data pattern.
//!
//! The surface is exactly ten tools. Each one owns a concept (orientation,
//! one finding, search, the graph, verification, drafting, deciding, agent
//! work, agent objects, external services); the dispatch in
//! `vela-cli/src/server/serve.rs` maps each onto the underlying analysis
//! functions. Schemas are strict: closed sets are enums, actor ids carry
//! patterns, required text carries minLength, lists carry limit bounds and
//! opaque cursors.
