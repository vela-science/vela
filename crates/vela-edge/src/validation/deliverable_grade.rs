//! Deliverable-grade taxonomy and the solve-language gate.
//!
//! The substrate proves the *log* trustworthy (signatures, content
//! addresses, append-only replay). It does not, by itself, stop a
//! proposer from attaching grandiose prose to a modest result — a
//! "verified reduction" dressed up as "first to solve #N". That gap
//! is a credibility leak: the strongest-sounding claim in the record
//! may be the least earned.
//!
//! This module closes it with two pieces, ported from the Erdős
//! campaign reference now retained as `verifier_gate_reference.py`
//! (the dogfooding that surfaced the need):
//!
//! 1. [`DeliverableGrade`] — a closed taxonomy of what a deliverable
//!    actually *is*, from `unconditional_solve` down to `honest_null`
//!    and `retracted`. A grade is a claim about kind, not strength
//!    (strength is [`vela_protocol::confidence`]; evidence polarity is
//!    [`vela_protocol::status_provenance`]; this is the third, orthogonal
//!    axis: *what was delivered*).
//!
//! 2. [`grade_gate`] — blocks "solve language" in a claim's text
//!    unless the grade is itself a solve. You may not write "resolves
//!    #647" on an `improved_published_bound`. This is a lint, not a
//!    cryptographic check: it catches the honest overstatement and
//!    the hype-cycle headline before they enter the record, the same
//!    way the OpenAI "GPT-5 solved 10 Erdős problems" claim (later
//!    walked back by Bloom) would have been caught at the gate.
//!
//! Verifier evidence (the harder gate) is [`vela_protocol::verifier_attachment`].
