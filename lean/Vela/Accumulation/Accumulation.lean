# Succinct accumulation of verified scientific state (the scaling core of PoVD)

`PoVD.lean` proves the anti-gaming core of permissionless accumulation, but its honest gap is the same
one Bitcoin's headers/SPV closed: deciding "this is the true verified frontier" by replaying the
accepted-delta history is O(history) — every verifier is re-run. Bitcoin's *scale* came from
verification being cheap relative to the work that built the chain; a light client checks a
constant-size object, not the whole history.

This file proves the abstract heart of that scaling property for science. Following the
folding/accumulation-scheme line (Nova → HyperNova, CRYPTO 2024; MicroNova, IEEE S&P 2025) and
Proof-Carrying Data (Bünz et al.), we model an **accumulator**: a constant-size object carrying the
running verified `state` plus a single integrity bit `ok`. Folding a delta keeps `ok = true` only if
the delta passed its frozen verifier AND strictly improved its frontier. The load-bearing theorem
(`accumulate_sound`) is that **the single bit certifies the entire history**: if the final
accumulator's `ok` is true, then *every* delta ever folded passed verification — even though a checker
inspects only the constant-size accumulator, never the unbounded list.

This is the abstract soundness a real recursive-SNARK / PCD instantiation must preserve. It is
Mathlib-free and compiles standalone (`lean Vela/Accumulation.lean`).

## Honest scope (the parts a real instantiation must still supply)
* **Constant-size is modelled, not enforced.** `Acc` is `O(1)` in the number of deltas (a state map +
  one bit), and the checker `globalCheck` reads only `Acc`. But Lean does not bill the cost of *carrying*
  the soundness argument; a real system needs a recursive SNARK / folding scheme so the *proof* of `ok`
  is also `O(1)`, not just the object. That cryptographic instantiation is out of scope here.
* **Single verifier here.** This file folds one frozen verifier. The cross-frontier (heterogeneous)
  case — importing one frontier's verified state into another's accumulator via a soundness-preserving
  transfer — is proved separately in `Vela/Accumulation/HeteroAccumulation.lean`; it is not proved in
  this file.
* **Adoption is unwillable.** As with PoVD, mechanism + proof is necessary, not sufficient, for a
  breakthrough.
