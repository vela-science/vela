// binary cannot run.
/// Commands intentionally withheld from the released surface. A DENY list,
/// not an ALLOW list: hiding a command here is safe (the worst case is a
/// real command stays unreachable until removed from the list), whereas the

/// a NEW command silently 404'd ("unknown or non-release command") until
/// someone remembered to add its string. Empty today.

Version control for scientific state.
Agents propose. Verifiers reproduce. Humans accept. Git publishes.

Usage:
  vela <COMMAND>

Setup (once):
  id            Your key + identity (create/show/import/keygen/sign); then no
                --key/--as flags. `id sign` re-signs your unsigned events.
  init          Initialize a new frontier repo (git-native: .vela is committed,
                CI gate + agent charter + MCP scaffolded)

The loop:
  status        One-screen frontier state
  inbox         Pending proposals awaiting a human key
  log           Recent signed events; `vela log <dir> <vf_>` = one finding's history
  diff          Two frontiers, or one pending proposal previewed
  record        Record activity into a portable claim packet (vrc_): claim +
                hashed artifacts + caveats; --propose lands it pending review
  propose       Draft the common finding.review proposal
  review        Signed human judgments: statement-fidelity verdicts (--fidelity,
                --batch) and role-scoped reviewer attestations
  accept        Apply proposals under your key; --all-pending/--id for the batch,
                --pack vsd_… for one atomic changeset decision
  pack          Bundle pending proposals into a changeset (vsd_) — the
                pull-request analogue; `vela pack . vsd_…` shows one
  proposals     The full proposal store: list/show/preview/import/validate/export/
                accept/reject
  attach        Bind mechanical verifier evidence (or --proof lean_kernel) to a finding

Verify:
  sign          THE human ceremony: everything awaiting your key, one
                session, one confirm, one key read. Agents are refused.
  policy        Standing rules (draft/test/sign/revoke/log): what agents
                may land without you. Signing a policy IS the autonomy.
  check         The full trust gate: replay, signatures, parity (--strict)
  reproduce     Re-verify stored witnesses from scratch (frozen verifiers)
  proof         Export a proof packet; `proof verify` re-checks one, `proof explain`
  gate          Claim-level verification gate (grade/check/vocab/backfill/auto-admit)

Publish (git push IS publication):
  hub           The index: register-git (bind repo->vfr once), witness-check,
                verify-chain, verify-log

Nouns (run `vela <noun> --help`):
  finding       The core primitive: add/show/supersede/note/caveat/revise/reject/retract/link
  frontier      Repo-level: new/materialize/add-dep/list-deps/diff/release/audit
  actor         Frontier-registered identities: add/list/rotate
  agents        VELA.md charter adapters: sync/doctor/diff
  serve         MCP + HTTP read surface (profiles: read-only/draft/maintainer)

Projections (read-only):
  state         Claim-state cell, trust vector, packs, evidence diff, anchors
  atlas         Cross-frontier math atlas projections
  policy        Governance policy: show/seal/test/evaluate
  doctor        First-user diagnosis of checkout/frontier/proof/serve
  foundry       The discovery/prover plane: run/targets/ablate, campaign,
                lean, attempt, transfer, experiment

Off-menu (reachable, intentionally undocumented here): {}
"#,
        env!("CARGO_PKG_VERSION"),
        deprecated_line,
    )
}
