//! T7: the typed claim-level edge layer — the FrontierGraph substrate.
//!
//! The full `.vela/graph/frontier-graph.v1.json` export is a broad
//! provenance graph (findings, sources, events, proposals, evidence
//! atoms — tens of thousands of nodes) built by the Python tooling.
//! This module is the *claim-level* view T7 reasons over: findings as
//! nodes (Claim nodes), and the typed relations between them
//! (`SUPPORTS / CONTRADICTS / DEPENDS_ON / DERIVED_FROM / IMPROVES /
//! GENERALIZES / SPECIALIZES / SUPERSEDES`, plus the legacy `EXTENDS`
//! and `REPLICATES`) as typed edges.
//!
//! It is a derived view, like [`crate::project::ReverseDepIndex`]: built
//! from the canonical findings + links, never an authority. Where a causal
//! closure keeps only the `depends`/`supports` subset, the FrontierGraph
//! keeps *every* typed relation so queries like "which contradictions are
//! open" and "what improves this result" are first-class.
//!
//! Cross-frontier (`vf_…@vfr_…`) targets are recorded as edges to an
//! external node id but are not resolved here — cross-frontier
//! traversal is a separate step (P2). Within a single merged Project,
//! though, every endpoint that exists is linked.
