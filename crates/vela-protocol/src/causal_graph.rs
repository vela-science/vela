//! v0.44: Pearl level 2 — causal graph + do-calculus over the
//! frontier's claim-to-claim link graph.
//!
//! v0.40 (level 1) answered "given a finding's (causal_claim,
//! causal_evidence_grade), is the claim identifiable from that
//! design alone?" by lookup over a 3×4 matrix. v0.44 (level 2)
//! answers a different question: "given the frontier's directed
//! link graph, is the effect of *changing our belief in finding X*
//! on *our belief in finding Y* identifiable from observational
//! evidence (the rest of the graph) alone, or does it require an
//! intervention?"
//!
//! This is the back-door criterion lifted to the claim level. The
//! lift is novel — Pearl's original framework operates over
//! variables; Vela operates over content-addressed claims that have
//! parents (findings they depend on) and children (findings that
//! depend on them). The same d-separation algebra applies.
//!
//! Doctrine for this module:
//! - Graph nodes are findings; edges come from the typed link graph
//!   (`depends`, `supports`, `mediates`, `causes`).
//! - `depends`/`supports`: directed edge from the source finding
//!   *to* the target it relies on. This is the convention we follow
//!   for back-door analysis: a finding's parents are the findings it
//!   depends on (its evidence base), its children are the findings
//!   that build on it.
//! - `contradicts` is undirected and excluded from the causal DAG.
//! - The substrate does not infer causal direction from prose; it
//!   only encodes what the link graph already declares.
