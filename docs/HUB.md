# Vela Hub

**Role (build-borrow / ADR 0001): the hub is an INDEX over git-replayed state,
not the authority.** The authoritative source of a frontier is its git repo (the
committed `.vela/events` log in `constellate-science/vela-frontiers`), reproducible
from a clean clone. The hub is a convenience layer: cross-frontier search,
reverse-dependency lookup, producer/reviewer pages, projection and event-stream
APIs, and the editorial "live" filter. It does not own byte custody (git + LFS
do), and it is not the write authority for acceptance (a reviewer's signed
`review.accepted` event in a PR is). Its one write endpoint is the owner-signed
git-remote registration: an owner binds a repo once
(`vela hub register-git <vfr> --remote <url>`, or POST
`/entries/{vfr}/git-remote` with a signed `vela.frontier-git-remote.v0.1`
record), and the hub re-derives the index by fetching the repo and holding it
to the one strict bundle (`verify_frontier_strict`: content-address
validation, strict reducer replay — never the loader's repair-lenient
degrade — and error-severity signature signals; a tampered signed event is
refused with "id does not re-derive"), then promoting with
`authority_mode='git_ingested'`. `git push` is publication. The signed
manifest publish (`POST /entries`) is removed (ADR 0001 Phase 2).

The hub is the public HTTP read surface for frontier state. Live reads
come from verified event and projection tables, and snapshot blobs
remain derived export artifacts.

Clients verify locally on read, so a compromised hub can withhold or
reorder, but cannot fabricate or tamper without breaking signatures and
hashes.

The public hub is **<https://hub.constellate.science>**.

## Doctrine

- **Event-first reads.** `frontier_events` preserves the exact event
  array order used for `latest_event_log_hash`. `frontier_objects` and
  `frontiers.materialized_snapshot_json` are projections from verified
  substrate.
- **The signature is the bind, not access control.** Anyone with an
  Ed25519 key can register their own `vfr_id`'s git remote. There is no
  allowlist of pubkeys on the public v0 hub; the strict-replay gate, not
  identity, decides what goes live.
- **Snapshots are exports.** `GET /entries/{vfr_id}/snapshot` serves a
  derived materialized snapshot. `?redirect=cdn` may return the
  content-addressed object-storage copy when one exists.
- **Broken latest rows do not go live.** A latest registry row that
  fails fetch, signature, schema, snapshot-hash, or event-log
  verification remains visible in registry history but is not promoted
  to `frontiers`.

## Endpoints

| Endpoint | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `GET /` | Banner + endpoint list + version. |
| `GET /healthz` | Liveness; reports DB reachability. |
| `GET /entries` | Live frontiers, returned as `vela.registry-entry.v0.1` index rows. |
| `GET /entries/{vfr_id}` | One live frontier entry. HTML reads the hub projection and renders findings inline. |
| `GET /entries/{vfr_id}/events?cursor=<event_id>&limit=<n>&kind=&target=` | Cursor-paginated canonical event log ordered by `seq`; `next_cursor` in the body resumes the walk. Unknown cursors return 400. |
| `GET /entries/{vfr_id}/events/stream?cursor=<event_id>` | Server-sent event stream. Emits backlog, then heartbeat while idle. |
| `GET /frontier/{vfr_id}/inbox` | Agent-facing alias for the event stream. |
| `GET /entries/{vfr_id}/snapshot` | Derived materialized snapshot JSON. `?redirect=cdn` redirects to the immutable blob when available. |
| `GET /entries/{vfr_id}/findings/{vf_id}` | Single-finding view: claim, conditions, evidence, links. Cross-frontier links navigate when dependencies are published. |
| `GET /entries/{vfr_id}/packs/{vsd_id}` | Pack review page: summary, member proposals with evidence-diff links, verdict state. |
| `GET /entries/{vfr_id}/reproduce` | Verify-this-yourself page: the clone → `vela check --strict` → `vela reproduce` block plus last-ingest commit and time. |
| `GET /entries/{vfr_id}/git-remote` | The frontier's registered git remote (url, ref, subdir, last ingest). |
| `POST /entries/{vfr_id}/git-remote` | The one write: an owner-signed `vela.frontier-git-remote.v0.1` registration binding the frontier to its repo. |
| `POST /mcp` | Hosted MCP endpoint (streamable HTTP, stateless JSON): the read-only tool surface over every live frontier, for remote agents with no clone. |
| `POST /webhook/github` | Push events kick ingest + the MCP refresher ahead of the interval sweeps. HMAC-authenticated (`X-Hub-Signature-256`). |

Historical note: `POST /entries` (the signed-manifest publish) was the
pre-git-native write path and is removed. Index rows are synthesized by
the ingest loop from strictly replayed repos; the
`vela.registry-entry.v0.1` shape survives only as the read-side row
format of `GET /entries`.

### v0.8: cross-frontier composition

A frontier published to the hub may declare cross-frontier dependencies
in its `frontier.dependencies` array, pinning each remote frontier by
`vfr_id` and `pinned_snapshot_hash`. Findings in the dependent frontier
can then link to findings in the dep via `vf_<id>@vfr_<id>` link
targets. The hub renders such links as clickable navigation between
entries; clients `git clone` each dep's frontier repo and verify the
pinned `snapshot_hash` locally.

The hub does not invent cross-frontier answers at storage time.
Resolution happens client-side, where the canonical-JSON snapshot pin
is the integrity guarantee.

## Publishing (git push)

The legacy signed-manifest publish (`POST /entries`) and hub pull are
retired (ADR 0001 Phase 2). Publication is `git push` to the frontier's
repo; the hub's ingest loop re-derives the index from the committed
event log. Bind the repo once:

```bash
vela hub register-git <vfr_id> --remote <repo-url>
```

## Reading

```bash
git clone <repo-url> && vela check <dir> --strict   # the authority path
curl https://hub.constellate.science/entries        # the index view
```

## Hosted MCP (`/mcp`)

Remote agents connect to the hub as an MCP server — no clone, no local
binary. The endpoint is streamable HTTP with stateless JSON responses
(POST a JSON-RPC message; no server-initiated SSE stream), backed by the
same dispatcher, profile gate, and tool registry as `vela serve`. The
projection is hydrated from the hub's own database — every live
frontier's materialized snapshot, the same rows `/entries/{vfr}/snapshot`
serves — and rebuilt when any promoted snapshot hash moves: on an
interval (`VELA_HUB_MCP_REFRESH_SECS`, default 300 s) or immediately
after a webhook push's ingest sweep lands. There are no per-machine git
checkouts in this lane.

Two consequences of hydrating from promoted state, stated plainly:

- `/mcp` serves only strictly-verified promoted frontiers. The retired
  checkout loader was lenient and could merge a frontier that had never
  passed the strict replay bar into the hosted projection; that leak is
  closed.
- A newly registered git remote appears on `/mcp` after its FIRST ingest
  sweep promotes it (≤ 300 s, or immediately via the webhook) — the MCP
  refresher no longer fetches repos itself. This also fixes the case
  where a live entry without a working git remote kept `/readyz`
  answering 503 forever: readiness now depends only on the projection
  tables, which such an entry already has.

Add it to any MCP client as `https://hub.constellate.science/mcp`
(transport: streamable HTTP, no auth). The tool surface is the read-only
profile minus the filesystem-path tools `verify`, `work`, and `objects`
(useless remotely, and `verify` mode=witness would be a CPU sink on a
public endpoint) — five tools: `orient`, `finding`, `search`, `graph`,
`external`. Every write verb and every decision verb is absent by
construction — the hosted endpoint cannot mutate state under any
configuration.

`vela serve <frontier> --http <port>` exposes the identical `/mcp` route
locally, so the remote and local contracts are the same surface.

## Webhook (`POST /webhook/github`)

The ingest and MCP refresh loops sweep on an interval; the webhook is the
latency lane that makes `git push` reflect in seconds. Configure a
GitHub webhook on the frontier repo (push events, content type JSON,
secret = the hub's `VELA_HUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET`); the hub verifies
`X-Hub-Signature-256` over the raw body and then kicks a targeted sweep.
Authenticity of state never rests on this header: whatever arrives is
still held to the strict replay bundle like every sweep. No secret
configured ⇒ the route answers 503 and the interval sweeps remain the
only refresh path.

## Git as remote (the frontier repo is the store)

A frontier's committed `.vela/events` log IS the store of record. The public
git repo (`constellate-science/vela-frontiers` for the canonical examples;
any frontier repo for its own state) carries the signed events, witnesses,
and sources; a plain `git clone` reproduces every witness with the hub
offline. The internal monorepo hydrates reconstructable state from git
(`scripts/hydrate-frontiers.sh`) with no hub fallback: a frontier git cannot
supply is a real error, never something the index papers over.

- **What is on the hub.** Nothing authoritative. The ingest loop fetches each
  registered git remote, strictly replays the committed event log (validation,
  reducer replay, signature signals), and promotes the result into the index
  with `authority_mode='git_ingested'`. The hub row is a projection of the
  repo, refreshed on every push.
- **The read side.** `git clone` + `vela frontier materialize`. The retired
  `vela clone`/`vela pull`/`vela workspace` verbs reconstructed working trees
  from hub bytes; that transport is deleted (ADR 0001 Phase 2).
- **The registry.** `scripts/workspace.json` remains as the conformance
  gate's discovery floor (which frontiers are canonical, which are strict) —
  gate configuration, not transport.

## Release verification boundary

Two distinct senses of "source of truth" must not be conflated:

- **Byte custody (the git-remote sense).** The frontier git repo is the
  canonical store for the event-log bytes and witnesses; the hub's copy is an
  ingest-derived projection. `git clone` is the read path. In this sense git
  is the remote of record and the hub holds no bytes of its own authority.
- **Scientific verdict (the trust sense).** The hub is signed transport. It is
  NOT the arbiter of what is true. Release checks can prove that the published
  `examples/sidon-sets` frontier id matches the expected snapshot and event-log
  hashes, but the authority for *correctness* still comes from re-deriving local
  frontier state, the signed events, and frozen-verifier proof-packet validation
  on a clean clone. A hub that served tampered bytes would simply fail to
  reproduce. The hub stores; the verifiers judge.

The live gate is operator-driven so normal clean clones do not need
network credentials:

```bash
VELA_HUB_RELEASE_CHECK=1 ./tests/test-hub-release-boundary.sh
```

Multi-hub witness checks remain optional. Set both environment variables
when two hubs are expected to carry the same witness pack:

```bash
VELA_HUB_URLS=https://hub.constellate.science,https://vela-hub-eu.fly.dev \
  VELA_WITNESS_PACK_ID=vsd_b6647b7d9bee0b0e \
  ./scripts/test-multi-hub-witness.sh
```

Agreement means the hubs returned byte-equivalent signed material. It
does not make either hub authoritative.

## CI bot actors (the BBB pattern)

A bot is just an actor whose private key lives in a CI secret. The
substrate already treats signing identity as portable — there is no
distinction between "human signs" and "bot signs."

```bash
# 1. Generate a keypair locally.
vela id keygen --out ~/.vela/keys/my-bot

# 2. Register the pubkey in the frontier with a tier.
vela actor add path/to/frontier.json reviewer:my-bot \
  --pubkey "$(cat ~/.vela/keys/my-bot/public.key)" \
  --tier auto-notes

# 3. Push the private key into a GitHub Actions secret.
gh secret set MY_BOT_KEY --repo me/repo < ~/.vela/keys/my-bot/private.key

# 4. Wipe the local copy. The secret is now the only authoritative
#    custodian. Rotation = generate a new key, update the frontier,
#    re-push the secret, commit. There is no "read out" of the secret.
rm ~/.vela/keys/my-bot/private.key
```

The BBB living-repo workflow at
[`.github/workflows/bbb-living-repo.yml`](../.github/workflows/bbb-living-repo.yml)
is a worked example.

## Self-hosting

The hub is one Rust binary plus a SQL backend — Postgres for production
or SQLite for low-volume self-hosted use (v0.21).

### SQLite (self-hosted, zero infrastructure)

```bash
cargo build --release -p vela-hub
VELA_HUB_DATABASE_URL="sqlite:///path/to/your-hub.db" \
  ./target/release/vela-hub
```

That's the whole setup. The hub auto-creates the schema on first
startup (`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS …`); subsequent runs reuse the
file. Ideal for a laptop hub mirroring the public one for offline use,
a small institution publishing one corpus, or anyone running the
federation pattern from §Federation without a Postgres dependency.

The SQLite backend serves every endpoint the Postgres one does:
`GET /entries`, `GET /entries/{vfr_id}`,
`GET /entries/{vfr_id}/events`, `GET /entries/{vfr_id}/depends-on`,
plus the git-remote registration and ingest loop — a self-hosted index
over the same git repos, no Postgres dependency.

### Postgres (production)

For higher concurrency / larger data, point at a Postgres URL instead
and apply this schema once:

```sql
CREATE TABLE registry_entries (
  id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  vfr_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  schema TEXT NOT NULL,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  owner_actor_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  owner_pubkey TEXT NOT NULL,
  latest_snapshot_hash TEXT NOT NULL,
  latest_event_log_hash TEXT NOT NULL,
  network_locator TEXT NOT NULL,
  signed_publish_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
  signature TEXT NOT NULL,
  raw_json JSONB NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
);
CREATE INDEX idx_entries_vfr_id ON registry_entries (vfr_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_entries_signed_publish_at ON registry_entries (signed_publish_at DESC);
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX uq_entries_vfr_signature ON registry_entries (vfr_id, signature);

-- Snapshot metadata is content-addressed by snapshot_hash. Bulk bytes
-- may live in object storage (Tigris/R2/S3) at blob_url, but snapshots
-- are derived exports. Live reads use frontiers/frontier_events/
-- frontier_objects after event-first promotion.
CREATE TABLE frontier_snapshots (
  snapshot_hash TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  schema_version TEXT NOT NULL,
  size_bytes INTEGER NOT NULL,
  blob_url TEXT NOT NULL,
  content_type TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'application/json',
  inserted_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
);
CREATE INDEX idx_snapshots_inserted_at ON frontier_snapshots (inserted_at DESC);

CREATE TABLE frontiers (
  vfr_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  registry_entry_id BIGINT REFERENCES registry_entries(id),
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  owner_actor_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  owner_pubkey TEXT NOT NULL,
  latest_snapshot_hash TEXT NOT NULL,
  latest_event_log_hash TEXT NOT NULL,
  schema_version TEXT NOT NULL,
  signed_publish_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
  snapshot_blob_url TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
  snapshot_size_bytes BIGINT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  findings_count BIGINT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  events_count BIGINT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  sources_count BIGINT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  evidence_atoms_count BIGINT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  condition_records_count BIGINT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  materialized_snapshot_json JSONB NOT NULL,
  authority_mode TEXT NOT NULL,
  status TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'live',
  inserted_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
);

CREATE TABLE frontier_events (
  vfr_id TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES frontiers(vfr_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  seq BIGINT NOT NULL,
  event_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  kind TEXT NOT NULL,
  target_type TEXT NOT NULL,
  target_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  actor_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  event_timestamp TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
  raw_json JSONB NOT NULL,
  inserted_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
  PRIMARY KEY (vfr_id, seq),
  UNIQUE (vfr_id, event_id)
);

CREATE TABLE frontier_objects (
  vfr_id TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES frontiers(vfr_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  object_type TEXT NOT NULL,
  object_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  seq BIGINT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  target_id TEXT,
  raw_json JSONB NOT NULL,
  inserted_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
  PRIMARY KEY (vfr_id, object_type, object_id)
);

CREATE TABLE frontier_publish_audit (
  id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  vfr_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  registry_entry_id BIGINT REFERENCES registry_entries(id),
  latest_snapshot_hash TEXT NOT NULL,
  signed_publish_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
  status TEXT NOT NULL,
  error TEXT,
  authority_mode TEXT,
  findings_count BIGINT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  events_count BIGINT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  sources_count BIGINT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  evidence_atoms_count BIGINT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  condition_records_count BIGINT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  verified_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
);
```

The executable schema source is
[`crates/vela-hub/src/db.rs`](../crates/vela-hub/src/db.rs) in
`POSTGRES_EVENT_FIRST_SCHEMA`. Use that constant or the backfill binary
for real migrations so indexes stay in sync with code.

### Event-first backfill

```bash
VELA_HUB_DATABASE_URL="postgres://..." \
  cargo run -p vela-hub --bin vela-hub-backfill-event-first -- --dry-run

VELA_HUB_DATABASE_URL="postgres://..." \
  cargo run -p vela-hub --bin vela-hub-backfill-event-first
```

The backfill selects the latest registry row per `vfr_id`. It fetches
from `frontier_snapshots.blob_url` when present and otherwise from
`network_locator`, verifies the registry signature, snapshot hash,
event-log hash, and schema, then promotes only verified rows. Failed
latest rows get `frontier_publish_audit.status = 'failed'` and do not
appear in `/entries`.

Direct Postgres publish helpers are intentionally absent after the
event-first cutover. New state arrives through the git-ingest loop so
strict replay, signature verification, event decomposition, audit
recording, and projection promotion happen in one path.

Deploy:

```bash
flyctl launch --no-deploy --config crates/vela-hub/fly.toml \
  --dockerfile crates/vela-hub/Dockerfile --copy-config \
  --name <your-hub-name> --org <your-org> --region <region>
flyctl secrets import --config crates/vela-hub/fly.toml < /path/to/prod.env
flyctl deploy --config crates/vela-hub/fly.toml \
  --dockerfile crates/vela-hub/Dockerfile .
```

The runtime needs only `VELA_HUB_DATABASE_URL`. Local dev can fall
back to `~/.vela/hub.env`. Other platforms work identically — the hub
is platform-agnostic; swap the runtime.

## Production runbook

Use these checks before and after any hub deploy:

```bash
cargo build --release -p vela-hub -p vela-protocol
curl -fsS https://hub.constellate.science/healthz | jq
curl -fsS https://hub.constellate.science/entries/vfr_496956067dc5ad79 | jq '.vfr_id'
curl -fsS 'https://hub.constellate.science/entries/vfr_496956067dc5ad79/events?limit=1' | jq '.events[0].id'
```

The Sidon-sets frontier (`examples/sidon-sets`, `vfr_496956067dc5ad79`, the
keystone OEIS-adoption frontier) is the public canary. It must be live,
pullable, snapshot-verified, and event-feed verified before a deploy is
considered healthy.

Deploy the hub:

```bash
flyctl deploy --config crates/vela-hub/fly.toml \
  --dockerfile crates/vela-hub/Dockerfile --depot=true --wait-timeout 600 .
```

**Always pass `--wait-timeout 600`.** New machines fail the `/readyz`
check until their hosted-MCP projection finishes its first build. That
build now hydrates from Postgres (no git clones), so readiness arrives
in seconds rather than minutes — the generous timeout is kept as margin
for slow DB cold-starts, and the old machine keeps serving `/mcp` until
the new one is ready. A deploy never blanks the public endpoint.

**Always pass `--depot=true`.** `vela-hub` lives in the `vela-237` org, but
flyctl's default remote builder is the `fly-builder-*` app in the (currently
suspended) `personal` org — deploys without `--depot` route to that dead
builder and fail with `error releasing builder: deadline_exceeded`. Depot
provisions a fresh managed builder scoped to the app's org and sidesteps the
fallback entirely. (The single-threaded `CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=1` in the Dockerfile
makes the final `vela-protocol`/`vela-hub` crates the slow part, ~6 min; it
guards against OOM on a small fly-builder. Depot builders have ample RAM, so if
the personal org is ever un-suspended this can be raised for faster builds.)

Rollback:

```bash
flyctl releases --config crates/vela-hub/fly.toml
flyctl deploy --config crates/vela-hub/fly.toml \
  --image <previous-image>
```

If a latest registry row fails verification, do not patch around it in
the database. Fix the frontier repo and push (the ingest loop retries
every sweep), or run the event-first backfill after the source locator
is repaired. The failed row belongs in `frontier_publish_audit`; it
should not be promoted to `frontiers`.

Nightly or pre-demo audit:

```bash
./scripts/full-conformance.sh --mode=ci
```

The gate hydrates every published frontier from the hub, reproduces the
canonical witnesses from scratch (`reproduce-sidon`, `reproduce-erdos`),
round-trips a cold clone (`clone-roundtrip-*`), and verifies decision
projections, artifact manifests, snapshot hashes, and event reads.

## Operational notes

- **Production credentials are not dev credentials.** The Fly secret
  is a Postgres role scoped to the hub schema tables and sequences. The
  dev sandbox URL in `~/.vela/hub.env` is for local testing.
- **Never paste connection strings into chat or commits.** If the URL
  ever appears in conversation, rotate the role's password.
- **Bot key rotation.** Generate a new keypair, run `vela actor add`
  to register the new pubkey in the frontier (replacing the old
  entry — `actor add` overwrites by id), commit, then update the CI
  secret. The old key stops being trusted as soon as the frontier
  re-publishes.
- **Hub compromise.** Anyone consuming the hub verifies the manifest's
  signature against `owner_pubkey` and the frontier's hashes against
  the manifest. The hub controls *availability*, not *authenticity*.

## Federation (capability, not active deploy)

Hub-to-hub federation is a *capability* of the protocol, not an
operational requirement. The doctrinal claim — *the signature is the
bind, not the hub identity* — was empirically validated end-to-end in
v0.20 against a second hub instance (`vela-hub-2`, since retired during
the current release consolidation: one canonical public hub at
<https://hub.constellate.science>, federation peers spun up by institutions
that need them).

The federation primitive remains:

```bash
vela registry mirror <vfr_id> \   # historical (v0.20 mirror primitive; retired)
  --from https://hub.constellate.science \
  --to https://your-hub.example.com
```

Mechanism: GET the signed manifest from `from/entries/{vfr_id}`, POST
the same bytes to `to/entries`. Both hubs validate the manifest's
Ed25519 signature against the embedded `owner_pubkey`. Mirroring is a
no-op for authenticity — neither hub gains any signing role.

What was validated end-to-end (the federation mechanism is unchanged; the
fixtures it was first proven on were the pre-consolidation AD cluster, since
retired):

- Multiple fixture frontiers mirrored cleanly between hub-1 and a peer.
- Re-mirroring the same vfr returns `duplicate=true` from the
  destination (idempotent on the `(vfr_id, signature)` unique
  constraint).
- pulling (via the since-retired transport) against either hub produced
  byte-identical bytes with `verified=true` — superseded by git clone,
  where byte identity is git's own guarantee.
- Snapshot hashes matched across hubs for the same vfr_id.

The public live list is now the math-wedge frontiers: Sidon sets
(`vfr_496956067dc5ad79`), Erdős problems, quantum codes, formal
conjectures, benchmark state, and the Erdős certificate lanes (see
`scripts/workspace.json` for the canonical registry). The retired AD
frontiers are gone from the hub; the mirror primitive is identical for any
frontier.

What this unblocks for any institution that runs its own peer:

- **Resilience:** any peer hub can register the same git remotes and
  serve the same index if the public hub is unreachable; the repos
  themselves are the store.
- **Seeding:** a fresh hub instance can be primed from the public one
  without any signing roundtrip.
- **Independent deploys:** mirror the public hub's content for offline
  / air-gapped use, then publish your own frontiers independently.
- **The right substrate property:** pulling a frontier doesn't require
  trusting a single hub. Any hub serving the bytes is sufficient
  because the signature is over the publisher's content, not the
  serving infrastructure.

What is intentionally *not* shipped here:

- A second always-on operational peer. Federation is a capability for
  institutions that want their own hub; it is not "high availability"
  for the public hub. If the public hub needs HA, that is a hosting
  decision (Fly autoscale, Neon read replicas), not a federation one.
- Automatic mirror (cron-style sync between hubs). The `mirror`
  primitive is the building block; an automated mirror is one bash
  loop or one CI job around it. Defer until someone runs it manually
  enough to feel the friction.
- Hub-A-discovers-hub-B / cross-hub queries (e.g. "which hubs have a
  copy of this vfr_id"). Each hub stays autonomous; clients pick which
  hub to talk to.

## What is deferred

Each of these is enabled by what's shipped, but not in scope:

- Hub-hosted frontier blobs. The locator is wherever the publisher
  hosts the file.
- Webhooks. SSE is live for event reads.
- Per-pubkey rate limits, allowlists, abuse handling. Add when abuse
  exists.
- A real domain (e.g. `hub.vela.science`). The Fly URLs are sufficient.
